"I was looking for a studio apartment in a quiet and suburban neighborhood known for its peaceful atmosphere and affordable living.  Found a listing on a local community bulletin board website with minimal details but a very low rent and a desirable location within the neighborhood.  I called the listed number and spoke to a woman who sounded elderly and eager to rent out the apartment immediately.  She claimed she was moving into assisted living and needed to find a tenant quickly to help cover her expenses.  She requested a 'key deposit and immediate access fee' of 5,000 rupees so she could arrange for someone to meet me with the keys for a quick self-guided viewing, as she was 'busy with moving preparations.'  I paid the amount via a mobile payment app, feeling sympathetic to her situation.  She sent me an address and instructed me to meet her 'neighbor' there with the keys.  Upon arriving at the address, there was no 'neighbor,' no keys, and no apartment available for rent.  Her phone number was immediately disconnected.  It was a quick and emotionally manipulative scam exploiting perceived vulnerability and urgency to elicit fast payment.",real_estate_rental_payment,Financial Crimes
"I was searching for a rental house with a small garden and basic amenities for my small family on a tight budget.  Found a listing on a website catering to budget-friendly rentals that seemed just adequate for our needs.  The 'landlord' was reasonably friendly and portrayed himself as understanding of the financial constraints of budget-conscious renters.  He mentioned he was currently out of town but his 'local handyman' could show me the house and small garden.  The 'handyman' met me at the property and gave me a brief tour of the small garden (claiming he didn't possess keys to the house interior at that moment).  He emphasized the landlord's willingness to rent to budget-conscious families and asked for a 'budget rental deposit' of 6,000 rupees to secure the house for our family.  I paid via cash, trusting his basic demeanor and the website's budget-focused orientation.  When I attempted to contact the 'landlord' again to schedule a viewing of the house interior, he became unreachable and the listing was promptly removed from the website.  The budget-friendly rental website, despite its focus on affordability, proved vulnerable to this scam.",real_estate_rental_payment,Financial Crimes
"I was urgently searching for a rental apartment as my temporary housing arrangement was ending unexpectedly.  Found a listing on a popular rental app for an apartment advertised as 'available now' and 'partially furnished' with basic utilities included.  The 'agent' who posted the listing was reasonably proactive and insistent, highlighting the immediate availability and low rent for the apartment.  He pressured me to pay a 'non-refundable verification fee' of 7,000 rupees to verify my identity and expedite the rental process for immediate move-in.  He claimed it was a necessary step for quick rentals.  Feeling rushed and in need of immediate housing, I paid via online transfer.  Upon visiting the apartment address, I discovered it was a completely different property than depicted in the listing photos, located in a less desirable area, and completely unfurnished and in poor repair.  When I requested a refund of the verification fee, the 'agent' became dismissive, citing the non-refundable nature of the fee and abruptly ending communication.  The rental app's customer support was unhelpful and offered no recourse.",real_estate_rental_payment,Financial Crimes
"I was looking for a shared apartment to minimize my living expenses and connect with other students in a student-friendly and affordable neighborhood.  Found a listing on a student housing platform for a room in a shared flat with other students in a convenient location near campus.  The 'poster' presented himself as a student roommate seeking a compatible flatmate to share expenses and create a student-friendly living environment.  He stated the rent was inclusive of basic utilities and internet access, and the room was available immediately for students.  He requested a 'student room deposit and student ID verification fee' of 7,500 rupees to reserve the room and verify my student status.  I paid via online banking, trusting his student profile and the platform's student-focused orientation.  He then began requesting further payments for 'student community access,' 'student utilities setup,' and 'student activity fees.'

I lost 7,500 rupees, but fortunately prevented further financial losses by recognizing the hallmarks of a student-targeted roommate scam exploiting student status.",real_estate_rental_payment,Financial Crimes
"I was browsing rental listings online when I encountered a basic advertisement promoting 'guaranteed budget rentals' and 'no credit checks' through a specialized low-income rental service.  Intrigued by the promise of affordable and accessible apartment hunting, I clicked on the ad, which directed me to a simple website with limited listings and testimonials emphasizing accessibility and ease of application.  I found an apartment that fit my limited budget and contacted them.  They assigned me a 'budget rental assistant' who was initially responsive and helpful, providing minimal property information and answering my basic questions.  He emphasized their 'guaranteed budget rental' service and requested a 'fully refundable registration and processing fee' of 6,500 rupees to initiate the apartment search and guarantee rental placement regardless of credit history.  I paid the fee online, trusting the website's focus on low-income renters and the assistant's straightforward reassurances.  However, after payment, the 'budget rental assistant' became increasingly unresponsive, and the apartment listings they provided were either in unsafe neighborhoods, in substandard condition, or did not align with my basic needs.  The 'guaranteed budget rentals' service proved to be a deceptive scheme solely designed to collect processing fees without providing any genuine rental assistance or guaranteed placements for low-income individuals.",real_estate_rental_payment,Financial Crimes
"I was searching for a rental house for a small family vacation on a very limited budget.  Found a listing on a budget vacation rental platform for a basic house with minimal bedrooms, a shared yard, and very basic amenities at an extremely low price.  The listing photos were sparse and low-quality, and the location was remote but acceptable for our budget vacation.  The 'host' was minimally communicative and somewhat curt, answering my inquiries briefly and offering limited information about the property and surrounding area.  He offered a 'basic discount' if I booked directly with him, bypassing the platform's booking fees and secure payment system.  He requested a deposit of 15,000 rupees to secure the booking, payable via a generic online payment link to his personal account.  Trusting his minimal demeanor and the extremely low price, I paid the deposit.  Days before our scheduled budget vacation, I attempted to reconfirm the booking arrangements, but the 'host' became completely unreachable, and the listing was abruptly removed from the budget vacation rental platform.  I realized I had been victimized by an ultra-budget vacation rental scam and was left with the daunting task of finding alternative accommodation for a small family vacation on a very limited budget and at short notice, resulting in financial loss and significant stress.",real_estate_rental_payment,Financial Crimes

Found a listing on a barebones property portal that appeared to be from a direct owner within the building.  The 'owner' contacted me and stated he was currently out of the country and his 'local representative' in the city would manage the rental process.  The 'local representative' contacted me and presented himself as a no-frills property manager focused solely on low-cost rentals.  He provided me with a rudimentary rental agreement and requested the first month's rent and a negligible security deposit – 20,000 rupees – to be remitted online prior to arranging a basic property viewing.  He justified this as a necessary procedure for ultra-budget rentals to minimize costs and paperwork.  I transferred the minimal sum via online banking, trusting the barebones presentation and seemingly rudimentary procedure.  Subsequently, both the 'owner' and 'local representative' became completely uncontactable.  The residential building management confirmed they had no record of owners with those names associated with the listed apartment and the listing was a very basic but effective fraud.

I filled out their online form with my loan requirements.  I got a call from someone who introduced himself as a loan broker.  He said he had found a great loan offer for me for 25,000 rupees.  He said his brokerage fee was 1250 rupees, which needed to be paid upfront before he could process my loan application with the bank.  It sounded like a standard brokerage fee, so I paid it online.  After the payment, he became less responsive.  He kept delaying the loan process with various excuses.  Eventually, he stopped taking my calls. I realized the 'loan broker' was a scammer who just took the brokerage fee and disappeared.  I lost 1250 rupees and the hope of getting a loan through a broker.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"I was using a mobile recharge app and saw an offer for 'Instant Loans on Recharges'.  It said 'Get a loan while you recharge your phone!'.  It seemed convenient and quick. I clicked on the offer and it took me to a loan application page within the recharge app.  I applied for a 4,000 rupee loan.  The app showed 'Loan Approved!' but then asked for a 'recharge processing fee' of 200 rupees.  It was a small amount compared to the loan, so I paid it through the recharge app itself.  After the payment, nothing happened.  The loan wasn't credited to my account, and there was no option to contact customer support within the recharge app for loans.  I realized the 'loan offer' was just a fake ad within the recharge app to steal money. I lost 200 rupees and learned not to trust loan offers embedded in other apps.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"I was browsing online forums for financial advice and saw a post about a 'cooperative loan society' offering low-interest loans to members.  It sounded like a good option for long-term, low-cost loans.  I contacted the person who posted about it through the forum.  They explained that it was a legitimate cooperative society and to become a member and avail of loans, I needed to pay a 'membership fee' of 1500 rupees.  They sent me a membership form and bank details to pay the fee.  Trusting the forum post and the idea of a cooperative society, I paid the membership fee.  After the payment, they sent me some generic documents but never processed my loan application.  They kept asking for more money for 'loan processing charges'.  I realized it was a fake cooperative society scam.  I lost 1500 rupees and trust in online forum recommendations.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"I received an email from 'Loan Assistance India' offering 'pre-approved business loans' with minimal documentation.  I have a small grocery shop and was looking for a loan to expand my stock.  This email seemed relevant to my needs.  I replied to the email and got a call from someone who sounded very professional.  He said my business loan of 50,000 rupees was approved.  To process the loan quickly, I needed to pay a 'GST and documentation fee' of 2500 rupees.  He said it was a mandatory government charge.  It sounded official, so I paid the 2500 rupees through online banking.  After the payment, they became unresponsive. I checked online for 'GST on loan processing', and there's no such thing.  I realized it was a fake business loan scam using GST as an excuse to extract money. I lost 2500 rupees and my business expansion plans are delayed.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"I was using a job search website and saw a banner ad saying 'Need Money? Get Instant Loans!'.  Being unemployed and actively looking for work, I was also facing financial difficulties.  I clicked on the ad and it took me to a website that looked like a loan provider.  I applied for a 6,000 rupee loan.  I received a call saying my loan was approved, but I needed to pay a 'job seeker support fee' of 350 rupees.  They said it was a special fee for unemployed applicants.  It sounded like another way to exploit jobless people, but I was desperate.  I paid the 350 rupees through UPI.  After the payment, they asked for more money for 'verification'. I refused and blocked their number.  I lost 350 rupees and felt even more discouraged in my job search and financial situation.  Scammers seem to target vulnerable job seekers.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"My neighbour recommended a 'loan agent' who could get loans approved easily.  He gave me the agent's phone number.  I contacted the agent.  He was very friendly and said he could arrange a loan of 15,000 rupees for me, even with my low CIBIL score.  He said his 'agent commission' was 750 rupees, which needed to be paid upfront for processing my loan application.  Trusting my neighbour's recommendation, I paid the 750 rupees to the agent through Paytm.  After the payment, the agent kept making excuses for delays and never got the loan approved.  Eventually, he stopped responding to my calls.  I realized my neighbour might have been tricked too, or maybe the 'agent' was just a scammer pretending to be connected.  I lost 750 rupees and the trust in neighbourhood recommendations.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"I was using a food delivery app and saw a promotional offer for 'Instant Loans for Delivery Partners'.  It said 'Get a loan to upgrade your vehicle!'.  Being a delivery partner, I was considering buying a new bike. This offer seemed relevant.  I clicked on the offer and it took me to a loan application page within the delivery app.  I applied for a 10,000 rupee loan.  The app showed 'Loan Approved!' but then asked for a 'delivery partner processing fee' of 500 rupees.  It was a small amount compared to the loan and seemed like a fee specific to delivery partners, so I paid it through the delivery app itself.  After the payment, nothing happened.  The loan wasn't disbursed, and there was no loan section within the delivery app to track my application.  I realized the 'loan offer' was just a fake promotion within the food delivery app to steal money from delivery partners.

"I received an SMS from 'Aadhar Loan Services' saying 'Get Loan up to ₹50,000 based on your Aadhar card!'.  It mentioned Aadhar card, which seemed official and government-related.  I was looking for a loan and this message caught my attention. I called the number in the SMS.  They said they offered loans based on Aadhar verification and I was eligible for a 20,000 rupee loan.  They asked for an 'Aadhar verification fee' of 1000 rupees.  It sounded somewhat plausible as Aadhar is used for verification. I paid the 1000 rupees through UPI.  After the payment, they asked for more money for 'loan insurance'.  That's when I realized it was an Aadhar-based loan scam exploiting the trust in Aadhar cards.  I lost 1000 rupees and learned not to trust loan offers just because they mention Aadhar.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"I was using a music streaming app and an audio ad played for 'Easy Loans - No Credit Check, No Income Proof!'.  The ad sounded very appealing as I have a poor credit history.  I clicked on the ad banner and it took me to a website.  I applied for a 10,000 rupee loan.  I got a call saying my loan was approved, but because of my bad credit, I needed to pay a 'credit risk mitigation fee' of 700 rupees.  They said it was a one-time fee to compensate for the risk of lending to someone with bad credit.  It sounded somewhat logical, so I paid the 700 rupees online.  After the payment, they asked for more money for 'processing'. I refused and blocked their number. I lost 700 rupees and realized even audio ads in music apps can lead to loan scams.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"I was on a matrimonial website looking for a life partner.  Someone messaged me saying they were a 'loan consultant' and could help me with any financial needs.  It seemed out of place on a matrimonial site, but I was curious. I replied.  He said he could arrange personal loans easily and asked about my loan requirements.  I told him I was looking for a small loan.  He said he could get me a 5,000 rupee loan, but his 'consultation fee' was 250 rupees, payable upfront.  It was a small amount, so I paid it through Paytm.  After the payment, he became less responsive and never arranged any loan. He just kept chatting about unrelated things.  I realized he was a scammer who used the matrimonial site to find vulnerable people and trick them with fake loan offers.  I lost 250 rupees and felt foolish for mixing personal and financial matters online.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"I received a promotional email from my bank saying 'Exclusive Loan Offers for Bank Customers!'.  Since it was from my bank, I assumed it was genuine and clicked on the link in the email.  It took me to a website that looked like my bank's website.  I applied for a 15,000 rupee loan.  I got a call from someone claiming to be from my bank's loan department.  They said my loan was approved, but for 'security reasons', I needed to pay a 'refundable security deposit' of 800 rupees.  They said it would be refunded along with the loan amount.  Since it was supposedly from my bank, I trusted them and paid the 800 rupees through UPI.  After the payment, I checked my bank account online and there was no loan credited.  I called my bank's customer care, and they said they had not sent any such email and it was a phishing scam.  I realized I had clicked on a fake email and website that looked like my bank's. I lost 800 rupees and learned to be more cautious about emails, even if they seem to be from my bank.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"I was using a UPI payment app and saw a banner ad for 'Instant Loans - Pay Later!'.  It said 'Get a loan and pay back with your UPI transactions!'.  It sounded convenient and integrated with my payment app.  I clicked on the ad and it took me to a loan application page within the UPI app.  I applied for a 3,000 rupee loan.  The app showed 'Loan Approved!' but then asked for a 'UPI transaction fee' of 150 rupees.  It was a small amount and related to UPI, so I paid it through the UPI app itself.  After the payment, nothing happened.  The loan wasn't credited to my account, and there was no loan section in the UPI app to track it.  I realized the 'loan offer' was just a fake ad within the UPI app to steal money using UPI transactions.

"I was looking for a loan against gold online.  I found a website claiming to be a 'Gold Loan Specialist' offering high loan values for gold.  I contacted them and inquired about a gold loan.  They said they could offer me a loan of 20,000 rupees against my gold jewelry.  They said for 'gold valuation and processing', I needed to pay a 'valuation fee' of 1100 rupees upfront.  It sounded like a necessary step for gold loans, so I paid the 1100 rupees online.  After the payment, they asked me to courier my gold jewelry to them for valuation.  That's when I became suspicious. Legitimate gold loan companies don't ask you to courier your gold.  I refused to send my gold and realized it was a fake gold loan scam to steal both money and gold. I lost 1100 rupees and thankfully didn't send my gold jewelry.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"I was watching news on a website and saw a side banner ad for 'Emergency Loans - Get Cash in Minutes!'.  The word 'emergency' caught my attention as I was facing a sudden financial need.  I clicked on the ad and it took me to a website that looked like a loan provider.  I applied for a 7,000 rupee loan.  I received a call saying my loan was approved for 'emergency disbursal', but I needed to pay an 'emergency processing fee' of 400 rupees.  They emphasized the urgency and said the loan would be disbursed immediately after payment.  Feeling pressured by the 'emergency' situation, I paid the 400 rupees through Paytm.  After the payment, they became unresponsive. I realized they were exploiting people's emergency situations to scam them.  I lost 400 rupees and the emergency financial need remained unresolved. I feel disgusted by their heartless tactics.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"I was using a ride-hailing app and saw a promotional offer for 'Driver Loans - Own Your Car!'.  It said 'Get a loan to buy your own car and become a driver partner!'.  I was thinking of buying a car to become a ride-hailing driver. This offer seemed relevant.  I clicked on the offer and it took me to a loan application page within the ride-hailing app.  I applied for a 50,000 rupee loan.  The app showed 'Loan Approved!' but then asked for a 'driver onboarding fee' of 2500 rupees.  It was a larger amount, but it was for owning a car, so I thought it might be a necessary expense. I paid the 2500 rupees through the ride-hailing app itself.  After the payment, nothing happened.  There was no loan disbursement and no car ownership process started.  I contacted ride-hailing app support, and they said they don't offer loans and it was a fake promotion.  I realized the 'loan offer' was a scam within the ride-hailing app to steal a larger amount of money. I lost 2500 rupees and my car ownership dream is shattered.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes

Being a working professional, I thought it might be a legitimate service. I replied.  He said he could arrange a loan of 20,000 rupees for me, but his 'professional consultation fee' was 1000 rupees, payable upfront.  It sounded like a professional service fee, so I paid the 1000 rupees through online banking.  After the payment, he became less responsive and never arranged any loan.  He kept giving excuses about bank approvals.  Eventually, he stopped replying altogether.  I realized he was a scammer using LinkedIn to target professionals with fake loan services.

We started chatting, and he mentioned he could help me with any loan needs.  I told him I was looking for a small personal loan.  He said he could get me a 4,000 rupee loan, but he needed a 'processing fee' of 200 rupees.  Since we were chatting and building a connection (or so I thought), I trusted him and paid the 200 rupees through Paytm.  After the payment, he became distant and eventually unmatched me on the dating app.  I realized he was a scammer who used the dating app to find lonely people and trick them with fake loan offers.  I lost 200 rupees and felt emotionally manipulated and foolish.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes

I got a call saying my loan was approved, and the 50% discount coupon was applied.  But even with the discount, I still needed to pay a 'processing fee' of 300 rupees.  Since it was a discounted fee and from a coupon website, I thought it was legitimate. I paid the 300 rupees online.  After the payment, they asked for more money for 'verification'. I refused and blocked their number.  I lost 300 rupees and realized even coupon websites can be used to promote loan scams with fake discounts.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"I received an SMS from 'Loan Helpline' saying 'Free Loan Consultation Available! Call Now!'.  I was confused about loan options and thought a free consultation might be helpful. I called the number.  They offered me a 'free loan consultation' and asked about my loan needs.  After listening to my requirements, they said they had found a perfect loan for me for 18,000 rupees.  They said the consultation was free, but to process the loan, I needed to pay a 'file processing charge' of 900 rupees.  It seemed contradictory to 'free consultation' but with a processing charge.  However, I was already invested in the idea of getting a loan.  I paid the 900 rupees online.  After the payment, they kept delaying the loan process and never provided any consultation.  I realized the 'free consultation' was a trick to lure people and charge them a processing fee for nothing.  I lost 900 rupees and learned that 'free' offers can be deceptive.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes

I got a call saying my loan was approved for 'medical emergencies', but I needed to pay a 'health support fee' of 600 rupees.  They said it was a special fee for medical emergency loans.

I got a call saying my loan was approved for 'travel purposes', but I needed to pay a 'travel facilitation fee' of 1200 rupees.  They said it was a mandatory fee for all travel loans.  It sounded like a fee related to travel loans, so I paid the 1200 rupees online.  After the payment, they asked for more money for 'processing'. I refused and blocked their number.

"I was using a online gaming platform and saw an in-game advertisement for 'Loans for Gamers - Enhance Your Gaming Experience!'. It promised quick cash for gaming needs.

Shortly after, I received a message stating my loan was approved but I needed to pay a 'gamer verification fee' of 100 rupees to activate the funds. Given the small amount and the gaming context, it seemed plausible in the heat of the moment. I paid the 100 rupees via UPI. Predictably, the loan never materialized, and the website vanished. It was a cheap trick, but in the gaming environment, it felt momentarily believable. I lost 100 rupees, a small sum, but it left a sour taste, realizing even gaming platforms are not immune to such scams.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"I was on a social media platform and saw a post from a group dedicated to small business owners. The post advertised 'Micro Loans for Business Growth' with a link to apply.

I applied for a loan of 15,000 rupees. I received an email stating my application was approved, but to finalize the process, I needed to pay a 'business registration fee' of 800 rupees. As it was for business growth and the amount seemed reasonable in that context, I proceeded with the payment through net banking. After payment, they requested further funds for 'loan insurance'. That's when suspicion arose. I ceased communication and investigated further, only to find the website was a fake. I lost 800 rupees, a setback for my small business, and felt betrayed by a community space that should have been safe.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"While browsing online classifieds for furniture, I stumbled upon an ad that subtly mentioned 'Easy Finance Options Available'. Since I was furnishing a new apartment and short on funds, I decided to explore it. Clicking the ad redirected me to a basic website offering 'furniture finance'. I applied for a loan of 6000 rupees, just enough to cover the furniture I was interested in. I quickly received a call informing me of my loan approval, pending a 'furniture delivery processing fee' of 300 rupees. The connection to furniture made it sound somewhat legitimate within the context of classifieds and new furniture. I paid the 300 rupees via online wallet. Subsequently, they asked for an additional 'transportation fee'. At this point, I recognized the pattern and refused to pay more. They became aggressive and stopped responding. I lost 300 rupees, and my new apartment remains sparsely furnished. I learned that even classified platforms, seemingly for goods, can be a gateway to loan scams.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"During an online shopping spree, I saw a banner ad on an e-commerce website promising 'Shopping Loans - Buy Now, Pay Later!'. As I was considering a larger purchase, this offer seemed convenient. I clicked the ad, which led to a dedicated page for 'shopping loans' within the e-commerce platform itself. I applied for a loan of 8000 rupees to cover my shopping cart. The platform indicated 'Loan Approved!' but then required a 'shopping cart verification fee' of 400 rupees before disbursement. Being within the trusted e-commerce environment and linked to my shopping, it felt like a standard procedure. I paid the 400 rupees via the platform's payment gateway. Post-payment, the loan never reflected in my account, and the 'shopping loan' section vanished from the website. It was a sophisticated scam, leveraging the trust of a known e-commerce site. I lost 400 rupees and the items in my shopping cart remained unpurchased. I was shocked to find such scams even within reputable shopping platforms.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes

As a student looking for extra income, this ad piqued my interest. I clicked on it and was taken to a website promising loans specifically for job seekers. I applied for a small loan of 4000 rupees. I received a prompt response stating my loan was approved, but I needed to pay a 'job placement processing fee' of 200 rupees to get the loan and supposedly secure a job as well. The combination of loan and job opportunity made it momentarily enticing. I paid the 200 rupees via mobile banking. Following the payment, they asked for more money for 'interview scheduling'. That's when I realized the dual scam nature – fake loan and fake job. I cut off contact and reported the website. I lost 200 rupees, but more importantly, it was a stark reminder of how scammers exploit job seekers' vulnerabilities.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"While using a mobile wallet app for bill payments, I noticed a promotional banner for 'Bill Payment Loans - Never Miss a Due Date!'. Since I sometimes struggle to manage bill payments on time, this offer sounded helpful. I clicked on the banner and it led to a loan application section within the wallet app itself. I applied for a loan of 5000 rupees, intending to use it for upcoming bills. The app showed 'Loan Approved!' but then requested a 'bill payment verification fee' of 250 rupees before releasing the funds. Integrated within the familiar wallet app and connected to bill payments, it appeared legitimate. I paid the 250 rupees through the wallet app. After payment, the loan never showed up, and the 'bill payment loan' section disappeared from the app. It was a cleverly disguised scam, exploiting the trust of a commonly used mobile wallet.

I decided to apply for a small loan of 7000 rupees. I received an email confirming my loan approval, but to activate my account and receive the funds, I needed to pay a 'platform activation fee' of 350 rupees. The peer-to-peer platform concept seemed to justify this fee as a platform charge. I paid the 350 rupees via online transfer. Subsequently, they asked for more money for 'investor matching'. That's when I became skeptical and investigated further. The platform was fake, and the peer-to-peer concept was just a guise. I lost 350 rupees, and my trust in online financial forums was shaken.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes
"During a video call with a friend, they shared their screen and showed me a website claiming to offer 'Instant Loans via Video KYC'.

I received a message indicating 'Video KYC Successful, Loan Approved!', but then it asked for a 'video KYC processing fee' of 500 rupees to release the funds. The video KYC context made this fee seem like a related processing charge. I paid the 500 rupees via UPI. Following payment, the website became unresponsive, and my friend later admitted their account might have been compromised. It was a sophisticated scam, leveraging the trust in video KYC and personal recommendations. I lost 500 rupees, and the online trust in my friend's recommendation was damaged.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes

The app displayed 'Data Backup Loan Approved!' but then required a 'data security processing fee' of 450 rupees before disbursing the funds. The context of data security within a cloud storage app made this fee seem plausible as a security measure. I paid the 450 rupees through the app's payment system. After payment, the loan never materialized, and the 'data loan' section disappeared from the cloud app. It was a bizarre scam, exploiting the trust in a cloud storage service and creating a false link between data backup and loans.

"While using a navigation app for directions, I saw a location-based ad for 'Nearby Loans - Get Cash Wherever You Are!'. The location-based aspect made it seem locally relevant and potentially faster. I clicked on the ad, which led to a website offering 'geo-location loans'. I applied for a loan of 6500 rupees. I received a message stating 'Location Verified, Loan Approved!' but then asked for a 'geo-verification processing fee' of 325 rupees to finalize the location-based approval. The geo-location context made this fee sound like a location-specific verification charge. I paid the 325 rupees via mobile wallet. Post-payment, the website became unreachable, and the loan never arrived. It was a geographically targeted scam, exploiting the convenience of navigation apps and location-based services. I lost 325 rupees, and my trust in location-based advertising is now diminished.",online_loan_fraud,Financial Crimes

The app indicated 'Wellness Loan Approved!' but then required a 'wellness verification fee' of 400 rupees before releasing the funds. The wellness context within a health app made this fee seem like a health-related verification charge. I paid the 400 rupees through the app's payment gateway. After payment, the loan never appeared, and the 'wellness loan' section vanished from the health app. It was a manipulative scam, exploiting the positive association with health and wellness.

He said they were viruses and he could fix them for 200 rupees. I paid through an online payment link he sent.  Afterwards, my computer seemed okay, but I kept getting calls from similar 'support' numbers.

Seriously messed up, they could have gotten into my computer and stolen everything.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

Stupid me, I clicked it.  Took me to a website that looked JUST LIKE the Chase login page.  I put in my username and password.  Then, like, a minute later, I got a real alert from Chase saying there was suspicious activity on my account.  I checked and someone tried to transfer money out!  Luckily, Chase caught it.  But I'm pretty sure that text and website were fake, spoofed or something.  It was too real, man.  They even had the right colors and everything.  Someone is trying to steal my money using fake Chase stuff.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Ugh, this is so frustrating.  I got a call earlier and my phone ID said it was from 'Apple Support'.  They said there was suspicious activity on my Apple account and I needed to give them my password to fix it.  I stupidly gave it to them because it looked like it was really Apple calling.  Now I think they stole my password.  How can they make it look like Apple is calling me? This is definitely spoofing, right?",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"This morning I got a call, and the caller ID said it was from 'Internal Revenue Service'.  They were saying I owed back taxes and if I didn't pay right now, they were gonna issue a warrant for my arrest.  I was freaked out, man! It looked exactly like the IRS number on my phone. They told me to go buy gift cards and give them the codes over the phone to settle the debt.  I did it, because I was scared of getting arrested.  Afterwards, I called the real IRS number from their website and they said they never called me and this was a total scam.  Those guys spoofed the IRS number! I lost like, $500 in gift cards!  This is messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a text message this morning, looked like it was from Amazon, you know, the usual delivery update thing.  It said there was a problem with my delivery and I needed to click a link to confirm my address.  Stupidly, I clicked it.  It took me to a website that looked exactly like the Amazon login page. I put in my email and password.  Then, like an idiot, I actually looked at the website address in the browser and it was all gibberish, not amazon.com at all.  I think they stole my login now. I changed my Amazon password but I'm still worried about what they might do.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, and my phone showed it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  I was kinda worried cause I'm retired and depend on that. The guy on the phone said there was some issue with my account and to verify my details, he started asking for my social security number and bank info.  It sounded legit at first 'cause it said Social Security on my caller ID, but then it just felt off, you know?  Like, why would they call me for this stuff? I hung up and called the real Social Security number from their website and they said they never called me and it was a scam, someone spoofing their number.  I'm just reporting this in case they try to do this to someone else.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I swear, this is messed up.  I got an email, looked like it was from Amazon, right?  Said there was a problem with my recent order and I needed to click a link to confirm my details.

I put in my email and password, and then, bam, my bank account gets hit with charges I didn't make.  Checked the email again later, the link was some weird [suspicious domain name] thing.

"Dude, I almost got scammed big time today. My phone rang and the caller ID said it was from ""IRS - Criminal Investigation Division"".  Like, seriously, it looked totally legit.  This guy starts yelling about how I owe back taxes and there's a warrant for my arrest if I don't pay RIGHT NOW.  He was super aggressive and kept saying I had to pay with gift cards to avoid jail.  Gift cards?!  That's when I got suspicious. I hung up and called the real IRS number from their website. They said they NEVER call like that and definitely not about warrants and gift cards. They said it was caller ID spoofing and someone was pretending to be them to scare people into paying.  This is messed up, it looked so real on my phone screen.  People could easily fall for this.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

Then, like a week later, I see charges on my card that are definitely not from Amazon.  I went to the real Amazon site, logged in directly, and there was no problem with my account at all.

They said there was suspicious activity on my account and needed to verify my card details to secure it. I gave them the last four digits of my card before I got suspicious.

They said my social security number was being used in some fraud case and I needed to verify my details to avoid legal trouble.

This guy with a really aggressive voice starts shouting that I owe back taxes and if I don't pay immediately through some prepaid card, they are sending the police to arrest me.  He knew my name and address which freaked me out. It sounded official at first because of the caller ID, but the way he was talking and demanding payment right away just didn't feel right. I hung up and checked online, and apparently, this is a common scam where they spoof the IRS number to scare people into paying fake debts.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Someone called me this morning, and my phone showed it was from 'Norton Security'.  I use Norton, so I picked up. The guy on the line said my subscription was expiring and they detected a virus on my computer. He sounded really official and said I needed to renew right away and let him access my computer to fix the virus.  He kept saying 'Norton Security Technical Support'. I was worried about the virus thing and almost gave him my credit card info and access to my computer like he asked.  Luckily, my daughter walked in and she told me to hang up because Norton would never call like that. I checked my Norton account online and everything is fine.  I think these people were trying to scam me by pretending to be Norton. My caller ID definitely said 'Norton Security'.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

It even had the Chase logo and everything.  I clicked the link, and it took me to a website that looked exactly like the Chase login page.  I put in my username and password, and then it asked for my debit card number and PIN!  That's when I got suspicious.  Chase NEVER asks for your PIN online.  I closed the page and went straight to the real Chase website and logged in there.  Everything looked fine, but I'm seriously freaked out that I might have given my info to scammers.

I clicked the link anyway just to be sure, and it took me to a website that looked exactly like the Amazon login page.  I put in my email and password, but then it asked for my credit card info which seemed weird just for suspicious activity.  I checked the website address and it was some jumbled mess, not amazon.com.  I realized it was a fake site trying to steal my info.

The website looked just like the real Apple login page, so I put in my Apple ID and password.  After I did it, I got suspicious. I checked online and found out about caller ID spoofing and fake websites. I think I got scammed. My caller ID said 'Apple Inc.' but it must have been fake and the website too.

Clicked the link, it took me to a page that looked just like the Amazon login page.  I put in my email and password.  Then, like, nothing happened.  Went to the real Amazon site myself later and logged in, and there was no problem with my order!  I'm worried now, did I just give my Amazon login to some scammers?  This email thing was totally fake, it was spoofing Amazon to steal my info.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I'm so pissed. Just got a call like an hour ago, and my phone ID said it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  They were saying my SSN was involved in some fraud thing and I needed to 'verify' my info to fix it.  Sounded kinda official at first, especially with the caller ID showing up like that.  They asked for my social security number again to 'confirm' it.  I gave them the last four digits, thankfully not the whole thing. Then they started asking for more personal stuff, like my address and date of birth, and it just felt off, you know?  I hung up and called the real SSA number I found online.  They said they never call people like that and it's probably a scam using caller ID spoofing to look like them.  Seriously, who does that?!  I'm worried they might have enough info to do something now.  This is messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

Then I got a weird text from my bank asking about a suspicious transaction for some website I didn't recognize.  I went straight to the real Netflix site, logged in there directly, and everything's fine with my account!  That email was totally fake, they spoofed the Netflix address to steal my card details.

He started asking for my account number, password, the whole shebang!  Something felt wrong, so I hung up fast. Called City Bank myself, using the number on my bank card, and they said it wasn't them.  These scammers are spoofing caller IDs now, it's insane!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, and my phone ID said it was from 'Social Security Administration'.

I hung up and called the real Social Security Administration directly, and they said it was a scam! My caller ID showed their number, but it was totally fake!  Someone is spoofing the Social Security Administration and trying to steal people's information. I'm so worried about what they can do with the info I gave them already.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

He wanted me to pay with gift cards, like right then and there.  Gift cards!  That's when I got super suspicious.  I hung up and called my accountant, and she said the IRS NEVER calls like that and NEVER asks for gift cards.  She said it's a total scam, someone is pretending to be the IRS by making their number show up on my phone!

I checked the link again and realized the website address was slightly different from the real Chase website.  They totally spoofed the text and the website.  I feel so dumb for falling for it.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"So, like, today my phone rings, and the caller ID says 'Social Security Administration'.  I pick up, and this lady is all official sounding, saying there's a problem with my social security number and my benefits are gonna be cut off.  She wanted me to 'verify' my info, like my bank account, to 'fix' it.  Sounded totally wrong, so I hung up and called the real Social Security number I found online.  They said it's a scam, someone's faking their number to steal from people.  These scammers are getting so sneaky with these fake caller IDs!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Yesterday, around lunchtime, my phone rang and the caller ID popped up 'Social Security Administration'. I was expecting a call about my benefits so I answered. This guy with a really official sounding voice told me my social security number had been compromised and used in some crime in Texas. He said to protect my account, I needed to verify some info and transfer funds to a 'secure' account immediately. He wanted my bank account details and kept pushing me to act fast.  Something felt off, it was too aggressive. I hung up and called the real Social Security Administration using the number on their website. They said it was a scam, caller ID spoofing.  These people are unbelievable! Trying to scare people like that.  Report this caller ID: [phone number - redacted for privacy].  They are spoofing the Social Security Administration.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"OMG, I just got a call and my phone ID said it was the Social Security Administration! They were saying my social security number was being used in a crime and I had to give them money to fix it. I was freaking out! I almost gave them my bank info but then I hung up and called the actual SSA and they told me it's a scam and someone is spoofing their number. This is terrifying!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I am so pissed right now. I got this email, looked exactly like it was from my bank, Chase.  Like, logo and everything. Said my account was locked and I needed to verify my info or something.  Stupid me, I clicked the link and put in my username and password.  Then it asked for my social security number and that's when I got a bad feeling.  Went to the real Chase website and logged in there directly, and guess what? No account lock.  Checked the email again, and the link was different if you looked close.  These scammers made a fake website that looks just like Chase to steal my info.  I changed my password now, but I'm worried they got my details.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, and the caller ID showed it was from 'Internal Revenue Service'.  They said I owed back taxes and threatened to arrest me if I didn't pay immediately.  They told me to buy gift cards and give them the numbers.  Sounded legit 'cause of the caller ID, but then I got to thinking, the IRS never calls like that, right?  I think it was a scam, spoofing their number to scare me.  I didn't give them anything, but I'm worried they'll try again or target someone else.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Okay, so this is what happened. I got an email, looked totally legit, like from PayPal. Said there was some weird activity on my account and I needed to log in to check it.  It even had the PayPal logo and everything. I clicked the link in the email, and it took me to a website that looked exactly like the PayPal login page. I put in my email and password.  Then, like, the next day, I checked my real PayPal account and there was nothing wrong, but then I saw a bunch of charges I didn't make!  I think that email was fake and that website was fake too, to steal my login.  Someone is pretending to be PayPal and ripped me off!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"So, like, I got this email, right?  Looked totally legit, said it was from Amazon, about my Prime membership.  Had the Amazon logo and everything.  Said there was a problem with my payment and I needed to update my card info.  Clicked the link in the email, took me to a website that looked EXACTLY like the Amazon login page.  I put in my email and password, and then it asked for my credit card details.  Something felt off, so I went to the real Amazon site directly, and there was no problem with my account!  Turns out, the email and the website were fake, spoofed to look like Amazon.  I changed my Amazon password just in case, but I'm worried they might have stolen my info already from that fake site.  This is messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I'm freaking out. Got a call just now, my phone ID showed 'FBI'!!!  They said my social security number was compromised and I needed to confirm it RIGHT NOW or they'd issue a warrant.  Sounded official as hell, 'cause it said FBI on my screen!  But then they started asking for like, my bank details and stuff to 'verify my identity'.  That's when I got sus.  FBI doesn't call you for that crap, right?  Pretty sure this is some kind of spoofing scam, making it look like they're the FBI to scare people.  Seriously messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got an email that looked exactly like it was from Amazon, you know, with their logo and everything. It said there was a problem with my recent order and I needed to click a link to update my payment info. I thought it was legit, so I clicked and went to a website that also looked just like Amazon's login page. I put in my email and password.  Then, like two days later, I saw weird charges on my credit card. I checked my real Amazon account, and there was no problem with any order.  I realized then it was a fake email and website trying to steal my info.  I'm so stupid for falling for it, but it looked so real!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a phone call yesterday, and the caller ID said it was from ""Social Security Administration"".  They said my social security number was being used in Texas for some illegal stuff and I needed to verify my info to fix it.  They were really pushy and sounded official.  They even gave me a badge number and everything.  I got scared and gave them the last four digits of my social and my bank account number.  After I hung up, I got to thinking, and I called the real Social Security office and they said they never called me and it was a scam.  Now I'm worried they're gonna steal my money.  My caller ID really did say ""Social Security Administration"", I swear it did.  I wouldn't have given them anything if it didn't look legit.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got this email, looked totally legit, like it was from Amazon, you know?  Said there was a problem with my account and I needed to update my payment info right away or they'd lock me out.  I clicked the link in the email, it took me to a website that looked EXACTLY like the Amazon login page.  I put in my email and password, then my credit card details like they asked.  Next day, boom, my bank calls me about fraud charges.  Turns out, the email and website were fake!  Someone spoofed Amazon to steal my info.  I'm so mad and feel so stupid for falling for it.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Some scammers called me today, and my phone ID said it was the IRS!  They were yelling about taxes and warrants and I almost panicked and gave them my card number.  Thank god I checked with the real IRS later, it was totally fake.  How can they make my phone show it's the IRS when it's not? This is scary!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"This morning I got a text message. It looked like it was from my bank, Chase.  It said 'Urgent Security Alert: Your account has been temporarily locked due to suspicious activity. Click here to verify your identity.' and had a link.  I clicked the link because it really looked like the Chase website, same colors and everything.  I put in my username and password.  Then, like an hour later, I tried to log into my actual Chase account and it wouldn't work! I called Chase and they said my account was compromised and someone had changed my password.  They said that text message and website were fake, spoofed to look like Chase.  I'm so worried about my money now.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call this morning, and my phone ID showed it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  The guy on the phone had a really official sounding voice, and he said my social security number was being used in a fraud case in Texas.  He said if I didn't cooperate, they'd issue a warrant for my arrest.  He asked for my social security number to 'verify' my identity and some other personal details. It sounded so real and scary, I almost gave it to him. But something felt off, so I hung up and called the real Social Security Administration number I found online. They told me they never call people like that and it was definitely a scam, probably caller ID spoofing to make it look like it was them calling. I'm really shaken up, and worried someone might try this again and trick someone else.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got an email today, looked legit, like from Netflix.  Said my account was on hold or something because of payment issues.  It had the Netflix logo and all that.  They had a link to 'update my payment info'.  Clicked it, took me to a website that looked JUST like the Netflix login page.  I put in my email and password, then my credit card details, you know, like you normally would.  Then afterwards, I got suspicious.  Went to the real Netflix website directly and logged in there, and my account was fine!  Checked the email again, and the link in the email address was a bit weird, not actually netflix.com.  I think they tricked me with a fake email and website to steal my credit card info.  I'm worried now about identity theft and stuff.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, and my phone showed it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  They said my social security number was being used for fraud and I needed to verify my information to stop it. They asked for my date of birth and social security number again, which I stupidly gave them because it looked like it was really the Social Security office calling.  After I hung up, I got to thinking, and it just didn't feel right. I called the real Social Security Administration number from their website, and they said they never called me and it was a scam using caller ID spoofing. I'm really worried about what they are going to do with my information now.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Ugh, I am so mad. I got an email this morning that looked EXACTLY like it was from Amazon, you know, with the logo and everything. It said my account was locked because of suspicious activity and I needed to click a link to verify my details.  Stupid me, I clicked it and put in my login and password.  Then, like an idiot, I realized the website address was all weird and not the real Amazon one.  I think they got my password now.  I've changed it, but I'm still freaking out they might have gotten into my account and ordered stuff or something.  This has to be some kind of fake email thing, right? Like they made it look real to trick me.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I just got a call, and my phone ID thingy said it was from 'Apple Support'.  They were saying my iCloud was hacked or something and asked for my password to fix it.  I almost gave it to them, but then I thought, wait a minute, Apple never calls me.  I hung up and looked up 'Apple Support number spoofing' online and BAM!  Tons of people saying it's a scam where they fake the caller ID to look like Apple.  Seriously messed up, they almost got me!  I changed my password anyway, just in case, but this spoofing stuff is scary.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"This is ridiculous! I keep getting emails that look EXACTLY like they're from Amazon, you know, with the Prime logo and everything.  They say my account is locked or something and I need to click a link to verify my info.  I almost did it the first time, but then I looked closer at the email address and it was all gibberish, not Amazon at all.  They're trying to steal my password or credit card, I just know it.  This is happening like twice a week now, it's gotta stop!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Okay, so listen to this. Yesterday I got a text message, right?  Looked legit, like from my bank - [Bank Name].  Said there was some suspicious activity on my account and to click this link to verify.  Stupid me, I clicked it.  It took me to a website that looked EXACTLY like my bank's website.  I put in my username and password.  Then, like, five minutes later, I get a real alert from my bank saying someone tried to log in from a weird location!  I checked the link again, and it was slightly different than the real bank address, like one letter off.  These scammers are getting so good, it's scary.  I think they spoofed the text message and the website to look like my bank to steal my info.  I've already changed my password and reported it to the bank, but I'm worried about what else they might do.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a text message yesterday, looked like it was from Amazon, saying there was a problem with my recent order and to click a link to fix it.  I did click it, and it took me to a website that looked exactly like Amazon's login page.  I put in my email and password, but then it asked for my credit card info, which seemed weird for a simple order problem.  I checked my actual Amazon account later by going directly to the website, not through the link, and there was nothing wrong with my orders!  I think that link was fake and they were trying to steal my info by pretending to be Amazon.  It was a really good fake, looked just like the real thing.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

Then, like, two hours later, my bank calls me saying there were suspicious charges on my credit card linked to Amazon!  Turns out that email and website were fake.  Someone completely copied Amazon's stuff to steal my info.  I'm so mad and worried about what else they can do with my details now.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, and my phone showed it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  I was worried because I'm retired and depend on my social security checks.  The guy on the phone said there was a problem with my account and that it was going to be suspended unless I verified some info. He asked for my social security number and bank account details.  It sounded official because it was 'Social Security' calling, right?  Luckily, my son was here and he got suspicious. He hung up and looked up the real number for Social Security.  We called them directly and they said they never called me and it was a scam using caller ID spoofing.  I almost gave them all my info! I'm so angry and scared someone would do this.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Yesterday, I got a call on my cell.  The caller ID said 'Social Security Administration'.  They said there was fraud on my social security number and I needed to verify my information right away or they would suspend my benefits.  I was so freaked out 'cause I rely on those benefits. They asked for my social security number to 'verify' and my bank account info to 'secure' my funds.  Luckily, my daughter walked in and told me to hang up, that it was probably a scam.

Sounded fishy, but the caller ID looked legit!  I hung up and called the IRS directly using the number on their website.

Almost fell for it, feel like an idiot now.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a text message, looked just like it was from Apple Support, saying my iCloud account was locked.  It had a link to click to 'verify' my info.  Looked real official, Apple logo and all.

Something felt off, so I checked the website address, and it was all weird and not the real USPS one. I think they spoofed the text and the website to steal my info.

"So, today I get a call, right? On my phone, it says 'IRS - Internal Revenue Service'.  I was like, oh crap, IRS calling me?  They said I owed back taxes and if I didn't pay right away, the cops were gonna come arrest me!  They were really aggressive and demanding, saying I had to pay with gift cards or something weird.  It sounded off, so I hung up and called my accountant. He said the IRS would NEVER call like that and it was definitely a scam, like they were pretending to be the IRS on my phone.  It really freaked me out at first, thinking it was real.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a text message that looked like it was from my bank, [Bank Name]. It said my account was locked and I needed to click a link to verify my info.  Stupidly, I clicked it and it took me to a website that looked just like my bank's login page. I put in my username and password.  Next day, bam! My account was drained.  I called the bank and they said they never sent that text and their website address is different.  These scammers are getting so good, it's scary.

I'm so worried about my money now.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I received a text message that looked like it was from my bank, [Bank Name].  It said there was suspicious activity on my account and to click a link to verify my details.  The link looked kinda like the real bank website, but something felt off.  I didn't click it directly but typed in my bank's website address myself and logged in there.  There was no alert or anything on my actual bank account. I think that text message was fake and trying to steal my info.  It was definitely spoofing my bank.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

This is messed up, they made it look so real!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"So, I got a call yesterday, right?  My phone showed it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  Like, official and all.  They said my social security number was compromised and I needed to verify my info to fix it.  Sounded kinda fishy, but it was the Social Security number on my caller ID!  They asked for my date of birth and address and stuff.  I gave it, stupidly, cause it looked like a legit call.  Then they started asking for my bank account details to 'verify my identity'.  That's when I got really suspicious and hung up.  I called the real Social Security office later using the number from their website, and they said they never called me and it's a scam using caller ID spoofing.  Now I'm worried what they can do with the info I already gave them.  This is messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"So, like, I got this call today, right? My phone ID said it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  I was kinda freaked 'cause they said my social security number was, like, suspended or something because of some fraud activity. They wanted me to verify my info to 'reactivate' it.  They were asking for my social security number and bank details.  It sounded kinda fishy, so I hung up and called the real Social Security office number I found online.

"I got an email today, looked exactly like it was from Amazon, you know, the same logo and everything.  Said there was a problem with my account and I needed to click a link to verify my details or they'd lock me out.  I was in a rush and honestly, it looked so real, I just clicked it and put in my username and password.  Then it asked for my credit card info! That's when I got suspicious. I checked the email address closely, and it was all weird and not really Amazon.  I went to the real Amazon site directly and logged in, and thankfully nothing seemed wrong there, but I'm still worried they might have stolen my password or something from that fake site.  This is messed up, they make these things look so real!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Okay, so this morning, my phone rings and it says ""IRS"" on the caller ID, like it's actually the government calling.  This dude gets on the phone, sounds all serious and says I owe back taxes and there's a warrant out for my arrest if I don't pay immediately.  He was super aggressive and kept saying I needed to pay right now with gift cards to avoid getting arrested.  It sounded insane, but the caller ID said IRS!  I almost freaked out and went to buy the gift cards but something felt off. I hung up and called the real IRS number from their website and they said it was a scam, definitely spoofing.

They were saying my iCloud account was hacked or something, and they needed to verify my details.  Sounded kinda weird, but the caller ID said 'Apple Support' clear as day!  They asked for my Apple ID password and security questions.  Stupid me, I gave it to them.  Then, like, two hours later, I tried to log into my iCloud and it was locked!  I called Apple directly, and they said they never called me and it was probably a spoofed call.  Now I gotta go through all this trouble to get my account back.  Seriously, who does this?!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

Then, like, five minutes later, I got a real alert from Chase saying my card was used for some weird online purchase I didn't make.  I checked the link again and realized the website address was slightly different from the real Chase website.  They totally spoofed the text and the website.

"So, like, today my phone rings, and the caller ID says 'Social Security Administration'.  I pick up, and this lady is all official sounding, saying there's a problem with my social security number and my benefits are gonna be cut off.  She wanted me to 'verify' my info, like my bank account, to 'fix' it.  Sounded totally wrong, so I hung up and called the real Social Security number I found online.  They said it's a scam, someone's faking their number to steal from people.  These scammers are getting so sneaky with these fake caller IDs!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Yesterday, around lunchtime, my phone rang and the caller ID popped up 'Social Security Administration'. I was expecting a call about my benefits so I answered. This guy with a really official sounding voice told me my social security number had been compromised and used in some crime in Texas. He said to protect my account, I needed to verify some info and transfer funds to a 'secure' account immediately. He wanted my bank account details and kept pushing me to act fast.  Something felt off, it was too aggressive. I hung up and called the real Social Security Administration using the number on their website. They said it was a scam, caller ID spoofing.

Stupid me, I clicked the link and put in my username and password.  Then it asked for my social security number and that's when I got a bad feeling.  Went to the real Chase website and logged in there directly, and guess what? No account lock.  Checked the email again, and the link was different if you looked close.  These scammers made a fake website that looks just like Chase to steal my info.  I changed my password now, but I'm worried they got my details.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, and the caller ID showed it was from 'Internal Revenue Service'.  They said I owed back taxes and threatened to arrest me if I didn't pay immediately.  They told me to buy gift cards and give them the numbers.  Sounded legit 'cause of the caller ID, but then I got to thinking, the IRS never calls like that, right?  I think it was a scam, spoofing their number to scare me.  I didn't give them anything, but I'm worried they'll try again or target someone else.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Okay, so this is what happened. I got an email, looked totally legit, like from PayPal. Said there was some weird activity on my account and I needed to log in to check it.  It even had the PayPal logo and everything. I clicked the link in the email, and it took me to a website that looked exactly like the PayPal login page. I put in my email and password.  Then, like, the next day, I checked my real PayPal account and there was nothing wrong, but then I saw a bunch of charges I didn't make!

Sounded official as hell, 'cause it said FBI on my screen!  But then they started asking for like, my bank details and stuff to 'verify my identity'.  That's when I got sus.

After I hung up, I got to thinking, and I called the real Social Security office and they said they never called me and it was a scam.  Now I'm worried they're gonna steal my money.

This guy with a really heavy accent starts saying my computer's been hacked and they detected all these viruses.  He wanted me to give him remote access to fix it.  Sounded kinda fishy, but the caller ID said 'Norton', so I almost did it.  Luckily, I got suspicious and hung up.

They told me to go buy gift cards and give them the codes over the phone to settle the debt.  I did it, because I was scared of getting arrested.  Afterwards, I called the real IRS number from their website and they said they never called me and this was a total scam.  Those guys spoofed the IRS number! I lost like, $500 in gift cards!  This is messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a text message this morning, looked like it was from Amazon, you know, the usual delivery update thing.  It said there was a problem with my delivery and I needed to click a link to confirm my address.  Stupidly, I clicked it.  It took me to a website that looked exactly like the Amazon login page. I put in my email and password.  Then, like an idiot, I actually looked at the website address in the browser and it was all gibberish, not amazon.com at all.  I think they stole my login now. I changed my Amazon password but I'm still worried about what they might do.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, and my phone showed it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  I was kinda worried cause I'm retired and depend on that. The guy on the phone said there was some issue with my account and to verify my details, he started asking for my social security number and bank info.  It sounded legit at first 'cause it said Social Security on my caller ID, but then it just felt off, you know?  Like, why would they call me for this stuff? I hung up and called the real Social Security number from their website and they said they never called me and it was a scam, someone spoofing their number.  I'm just reporting this in case they try to do this to someone else.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I swear, this is messed up.  I got an email, looked like it was from Amazon, right?  Said there was a problem with my recent order and I needed to click a link to confirm my details.  Looked legit, same logo and everything.  Clicked it, took me to a website that looked JUST like Amazon's login page.  I put in my email and password, and then, bam, my bank account gets hit with charges I didn't make.  Checked the email again later, the link was some weird [suspicious domain name] thing.  They totally spoofed Amazon, man, I'm out like 500 bucks now!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I am SO PISSED.  I got this email, looked totally legit, like from PayPal.  Said my account was limited or something, needed to verify.  Had the PayPal logo and everything.  Clicked the link, went to a page that looked EXACTLY like PayPal login.  Put in my email and password.  Next day, BAM! My PayPal account is cleaned out.  Turns out, the email and the website were FAKE.  Spoofed, they called it.  These scammers are getting too good, man.  They ripped me off good.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I almost got scammed big time today. My phone rang and the caller ID said it was from ""IRS - Criminal Investigation Division"".  Like, seriously, it looked totally legit.  This guy starts yelling about how I owe back taxes and there's a warrant for my arrest if I don't pay RIGHT NOW.  He was super aggressive and kept saying I had to pay with gift cards to avoid jail.  Gift cards?!  That's when I got suspicious. I hung up and called the real IRS number from their website. They said they NEVER call like that and definitely not about warrants and gift cards. They said it was caller ID spoofing and someone was pretending to be them to scare people into paying.  This is messed up, it looked so real on my phone screen.  People could easily fall for this.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"So, I got this email, right? Looked totally legit, had the Amazon logo and everything. Said there was a problem with my account and I needed to update my payment info or they'd shut it down.  Clicked the link in the email, and it took me to a website that looked JUST LIKE Amazon.  I put in my credit card details and everything.  Then, like a week later, I see charges on my card that are definitely not from Amazon.  I went to the real Amazon site, logged in directly, and there was no problem with my account at all.  I'm pretty sure that email and website were fake, like someone was pretending to be Amazon to steal my info.  This is messed up, I thought I was being careful.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Someone called me saying they were from the IRS.  My caller ID even showed 'Internal Revenue Service'. They said I owed back taxes and threatened to arrest me if I didn't pay immediately through gift cards. I was scared and almost did it, but something felt wrong.  I hung up and called the real IRS number from their website.  They told me it was a scam and they never call like that.  It was caller ID spoofing.  These people are horrible, trying to scare people like that.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
Someone called me saying they were from Amazon customer service. My caller ID even showed 'Amazon'. They said there was suspicious activity on my account and needed to verify my card details to secure it. I gave them the last four digits of my card before I got suspicious. I hung up and checked my actual Amazon account and there was nothing wrong. I think they spoofed the caller ID to look like Amazon. I'm worried they might try to use the last four digits to scam me further.,Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"My email... it's been hacked or something. People I know are getting emails from my address, but I DIDN'T SEND THEM!  It's asking for money, saying I'm stuck overseas and need help.  My cousin called me freaking out, saying he almost wired money before he called to double-check. This is insane! Someone is making it look like it's coming from me, but it's not. They're using my email to scam people! I need this stopped, like, yesterday.  This is ruining my reputation and scaring my family and friends.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Okay, so like, yesterday I got this email that looked EXACTLY like it was from Amazon.  The whole thing, logo, colors, everything. It said there was a problem with my recent order and I needed to click a link to confirm my payment info.  Stupid me, I clicked it.  It took me to a page that looked just like the Amazon login page, so I put in my email and password.  This morning, I checked my bank account and there were a bunch of weird charges I didn't make.  I went to the real Amazon website, logged in directly, and there was no problem with any order.  I think that email and that website were fake, like someone was pretending to be Amazon to steal my info. I'm really worried about my account now.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"This morning I received a text message that appeared to be from 'USPS'. It said my package couldn't be delivered because of an incomplete address and to click a link to update it.  I was expecting a package, so I clicked the link.  It took me to a website that looked almost exactly like the real USPS website, asking for my address and phone number to 'reschedule delivery'. I filled it out.  Later, I checked the tracking number directly on the official USPS website and there was no problem with my address, and the package was still in transit normally. I realized that text message and the website were fake, trying to steal my personal info by pretending to be USPS.  I'm really worried about what they'll do with my address and phone number now.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"OMG, I'm so mad right now! I just got a text message, like, just now. It looked like it was from my bank, you know, [Bank Name]?  It even had their logo thingy at the top. Said there was some 'suspicious activity' on my account and to click this link to verify my info.  I almost clicked it, I was about to panic! But then I looked at the link closer, and it was all weird and not like my bank's website at all.  It was something totally different, like some random letters and numbers.  I called my bank directly after that, using the number on my bank card, and they said it was NOT them.  They said it's a scam, like people pretending to be them to steal your info!  Seriously, who does that?!  This is total BS, I could have lost everything if I wasn't careful.  Someone is out there pretending to be [Bank Name] and trying to trick people with fake text messages.  They need to be stopped!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I almost got scammed big time! I got an email that looked EXACTLY like it was from Amazon, you know, with the Amazon logo and everything.  It said my account was locked because of some suspicious activity and I needed to click a link to verify my info.  Luckily, something felt off, like the link looked weird when I hovered over it, not the usual Amazon address.  I went to the real Amazon website directly instead of clicking the link in the email, and of course, my account was fine.  This email was a total fake, trying to steal my login details.  They made it look so real, it's scary how good these scammers are getting.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, showed up on my phone as 'Social Security Administration'.  They were saying my social security number was compromised and I needed to give them my bank info to verify my identity.  Sounded kinda fishy but the caller ID looked legit so I was worried.  Luckily I hung up and called the real Social Security number I found online.  They said they never called me and it was a scam, like someone was pretending to be them.

"I got a text message yesterday, looked like it was from my bank, Chase.  Said there was suspicious activity on my account and to click a link to verify.  Stupid me, I clicked it.

This is gonna mess me up big time.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Yesterday, my phone rang and the caller ID said 'Chase Bank'.  I bank with Chase, so I picked up.  The guy on the phone was all serious saying there was fraud on my account and they needed to verify my identity.  He started asking for my account number and password!  Like, right away!  I got super nervous and told him I'd call Chase directly. He kept pushing, saying it had to be done NOW or my account would be locked.  I hung up and called Chase using the number on my bank card.  They told me it was a scam and they never call and ask for that info.  The caller ID was totally faked!  These scammers are getting too good. It was really convincing at first and I was almost tricked into giving them my details.  This caller ID spoofing stuff is dangerous.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I swear I got a call yesterday, caller ID said it was my bank, right?  [Bank Name].  They were all like, 'Urgent security issue on your account, need to verify some stuff.'  Sounded legit, they knew my name and stuff.  They asked for my account password to 'secure it'.  Stupid me, I gave it.  Then today, boom, money's gone from my account.  Called the real bank, they said they NEVER call and ask for passwords.  Said it's caller ID spoofing or something.  Like, they faked being my bank on the phone.  Seriously messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Yesterday, my phone rang and the caller ID showed 'Apple Support'.  I actually use Apple products so I picked up. The guy on the phone said there was suspicious activity on my iCloud account and needed me to verify my password and credit card details to secure it. He sounded really official and even knew my name.  I started to give him the info, but then something felt off. I hung up and called Apple directly using the number on their website. They told me they never call like that and it was definitely a scam, probably caller ID spoofing.  I'm really worried now about my information being out there and how they even got my number to make it look like Apple.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"So, like, I got this call yesterday, right?  My phone showed it was from 'Norton Security' - you know, the antivirus thing?  I use them, so I picked up.  This guy with a really heavy accent starts saying my computer's been hacked and they detected all these viruses.  He wanted me to give him remote access to fix it.  Sounded kinda fishy, but the caller ID said 'Norton', so I almost did it.  Luckily, I got suspicious and hung up.  Then I called Norton directly from their website number and they said they NEVER call like that and it was definitely a scam using caller ID spoofing.  Seriously messed up, they could have gotten into my computer and stolen everything.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a text message this morning, looked like it was from my bank, Chase.  Said there was suspicious activity on my account and to click a link to verify my info.  Thing is, I don't even bank with Chase!  I checked the link, and it looked kinda off, so I didn't click it.  Pretty sure someone was trying to steal my info by pretending to be Chase bank.  This is messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Ugh, I'm so mad. Today I got a text message, right?  Looked like it was from my bank, Chase.  Said 'Urgent! Your account is locked, click here to verify'.  It even had the Chase logo in the text.  Stupid me, I clicked it.  Took me to a website that looked JUST LIKE the Chase login page.  I put in my username and password.  Then, like, a minute later, I got a real alert from Chase saying there was suspicious activity on my account.  I checked and someone tried to transfer money out!  Luckily, Chase caught it.  But I'm pretty sure that text and website were fake, spoofed or something.  It was too real, man.  They even had the right colors and everything.  Someone is trying to steal my money using fake Chase stuff.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Ugh, this is so frustrating.  I got a call earlier and my phone ID said it was from 'Apple Support'.  They said there was suspicious activity on my Apple account and I needed to give them my password to fix it.  I stupidly gave it to them because it looked like it was really Apple calling.  Now I think they stole my password.  How can they make it look like Apple is calling me? This is definitely spoofing, right?",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

"Yesterday I got a call on my cell.  The caller ID looked exactly like it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  They even had the official number I see on their website.  A guy with a serious voice said there was some problem with my social security number and potential fraud. He asked me to verify my date of birth and social security number to 'confirm my identity' and 'fix the issue'.  I got nervous and gave him the info.  After I hung up, I felt something was off. I called the real Social Security Administration using a number from their official website, and they said they never called me and it was a spoofed number.  Now I'm really worried someone stole my identity.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"So, I got this call yesterday, right? My phone showed it was from 'Social Security Admin'.  I was like, huh?  Answered it, and this guy on the other end, sounded all official, said there was some problem with my social security number, like it was used for something illegal or something.  He was saying I needed to verify my info to fix it and avoid getting arrested.  He asked for my social security number and date of birth.  I got kinda freaked out and gave it to him.  Then he started asking for bank account details, and that's when I got suspicious.  I hung up and called the real Social Security office, and they told me it was a scam, that they never call like that.  My caller ID showed 'Social Security Admin' though, I swear it did.  I think someone faked the number to trick me.  I'm worried now about my identity being stolen.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I am freaking out. I just got a call, and my phone said it was from 'City Police Dept'.  They said there's like, a warrant for my arrest or something crazy, and I needed to pay some fine RIGHT NOW to avoid getting arrested.  They were super pushy and sounded legit, knew my name and everything.  I almost panicked and was gonna wire them money, but my gut was telling me something was off.  I hung up and called the real police department number from Google, and they said it's a scam, some kind of spoofing thing with the caller ID.  Seriously, who does this?!  I'm still shaken up, it felt so real.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"So, like, today I got this call, right? And my phone ID thingy said it was from 'Apple Support'.  I was having trouble with my iCloud, so I actually picked up.  This guy on the phone, he sounded all official and knew my name and stuff. He said my account was compromised and that I needed to give him access to my computer to fix it.  He sent me a link to some website that looked just like the Apple website, all white and with the apple logo.  I logged in there, thinking it was real.  Then he started asking for like, all sorts of passwords and security questions for everything!  That's when I got a bad feeling.  I hung up and called Apple directly from their real website.  They said they never called me and that website wasn't theirs at all!  I think I gave them my Apple ID password on that fake site!  I'm so worried they're gonna steal all my photos and stuff now.  This is messed up, man.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, this is messed up. I got an email, like, looked totally legit from Amazon. Said there was a problem with my recent order and I needed to click a link to verify my info.  I was expecting a delivery, so I clicked it without even thinking.  It took me to a page that looked exactly like the Amazon login page.  I put in my email and password.  Next day, BAM!

It said there was a problem with my recent order and to click a link to fix it.  Stupid me, I clicked it. It took me to a website that looked JUST LIKE the Amazon login page. I put in my email and password.  Then, like, two days later, my bank called me about suspicious activity on my credit card. Turns out, someone used my Amazon account to buy a bunch of stuff and then used my card. I checked the link from the email again, and now I see it's not the real Amazon address - it's something close but not quite.  I'm so mad and worried about what else they might have gotten.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

This is ridiculous, it looked so real!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"This morning, I received a phone call that appeared to be from my bank, [Bank Name]. The number on my caller ID was the same number I always see when they call me for legitimate reasons.  The person on the phone said there was suspicious activity on my account and they needed to verify my identity to secure it. They asked for my account number and online banking password.  I got suspicious when they started asking for my security questions, as the real bank never asks for those over the phone. I hung up and called my bank directly using the number on my bank statement. They confirmed that they had NOT called me and that it was likely a scam using caller ID spoofing to look like they were calling from [Bank Name]. I'm really worried because I almost gave them my information and I'm concerned about how easily they can fake the caller ID like that. This is scary!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got this email today, looked exactly like it was from Amazon.  Said there was a problem with my recent order and I needed to click a link to verify my account.  I buy a lot from Amazon so I just clicked it without thinking.  It took me to a login page that looked just like Amazon's, so I put in my email and password.  Then after I logged in, it looked weird, not like the real Amazon site.  I checked my real Amazon account directly and there's no problem with my orders.  I think that email was a fake, pretending to be Amazon to steal my password.  Now I'm freaking out they'll get into my account and steal my info or something. This is BS, it looked so real.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

Said my account was on hold because of a payment issue and I needed to update my details right away.  I clicked the link, and it took me to a website that also looked just like Netflix. I put in my credit card info, thinking it was fixing the problem.  Then I got a weird text from my bank about suspicious activity and realized it was all fake.

He told me I needed to verify my information to clear things up and asked for my social security number and bank account details to 'verify my identity'.  It sounded scary and real.  I almost gave him the info, but something felt off.  I hung up and called the real Social Security office number I found online.

This whole thing is messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, and the caller ID showed it was from 'Internal Revenue Service'.  I was shocked because, you know, IRS calling you directly is never good. The guy on the phone, he sounded official, like really serious. He said I owed back taxes and if I didn't pay immediately, they were gonna issue a warrant for my arrest.  He was really pushy and kept saying I had to pay with gift cards - which now I know is a HUGE red flag, but in the moment, I was panicked.  I went to the store and bought $500 worth of gift cards and gave him the codes over the phone.  After I hung up, I got to thinking, this whole thing felt wrong. I called the real IRS number from their website, and they said they NEVER call like that and especially not asking for gift cards.

The guy on the phone was saying my account was compromised and I needed to transfer my money to a 'secure account' to protect it. He was so convincing, knew details about my account, I panicked and did exactly what he said.  Later, I called the actual bank using the number on their website, and they told me it was a scam, that they never called me.  They spoofed their number!  All my savings are gone!

They said my bill was overdue and they were gonna shut off my power in like an hour if I didn't pay RIGHT NOW over the phone.  They even knew my address!  I was panicking 'cause I thought I paid it, but maybe I missed it.  They wanted me to use some prepaid card thing, which seemed weird, but I was stressed about the power going out.  Luckily, I decided to call City Power & Light directly using the number on my bill, and they said MY ACCOUNT WAS FINE and they NEVER call people like that for payments.

I hung up and called the real SSA number from their website, and they said they NEVER call people like that and it's a common scam.  My caller ID clearly said 'Social Security Administration'!  This has to be spoofing, right?  I'm worried they might have gotten some info even though I didn't give them everything.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

They were saying my SSN was involved in some fraud thing and I needed to 'verify' my info to fix it.  Sounded kinda official at first, especially with the caller ID showing up like that.  They asked for my social security number again to 'confirm' it.  I gave them the last four digits, thankfully not the whole thing. Then they started asking for more personal stuff, like my address and date of birth, and it just felt off, you know?  I hung up and called the real SSA number I found online.  They said they never call people like that and it's probably a scam using caller ID spoofing to look like them.  Seriously, who does that?!

It took me to a website that looked exactly like the Chase login page. I put in my username and password.  Then, like, five minutes later, I got a real alert from Chase saying my card was used for some weird online purchase I didn't make.  I checked the link again and realized the website address was slightly different from the real Chase website.  They totally spoofed the text and the website.  I feel so dumb for falling for it.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"So, like, today my phone rings, and the caller ID says 'Social Security Administration'.  I pick up, and this lady is all official sounding, saying there's a problem with my social security number and my benefits are gonna be cut off.  She wanted me to 'verify' my info, like my bank account, to 'fix' it.  Sounded totally wrong, so I hung up and called the real Social Security number I found online.  They said it's a scam, someone's faking their number to steal from people.  These scammers are getting so sneaky with these fake caller IDs!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Yesterday, around lunchtime, my phone rang and the caller ID popped up 'Social Security Administration'. I was expecting a call about my benefits so I answered. This guy with a really official sounding voice told me my social security number had been compromised and used in some crime in Texas. He said to protect my account, I needed to verify some info and transfer funds to a 'secure' account immediately. He wanted my bank account details and kept pushing me to act fast.  Something felt off, it was too aggressive. I hung up and called the real Social Security Administration using the number on their website. They said it was a scam, caller ID spoofing.  These people are unbelievable! Trying to scare people like that.  Report this caller ID: [phone number - redacted for privacy].  They are spoofing the Social Security Administration.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"My email... it's been hacked or something. People I know are getting emails from my address, but I DIDN'T SEND THEM!  It's asking for money, saying I'm stuck overseas and need help.  My cousin called me freaking out, saying he almost wired money before he called to double-check. This is insane! Someone is making it look like it's coming from me, but it's not. They're using my email to scam people! I need this stopped, like, yesterday.  This is ruining my reputation and scaring my family and friends.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Okay, so like, yesterday I got this email that looked EXACTLY like it was from Amazon.  The whole thing, logo, colors, everything. It said there was a problem with my recent order and I needed to click a link to confirm my payment info.  Stupid me, I clicked it.  It took me to a page that looked just like the Amazon login page, so I put in my email and password.  This morning, I checked my bank account and there were a bunch of weird charges I didn't make.  I went to the real Amazon website, logged in directly, and there was no problem with any order.  I think that email and that website were fake, like someone was pretending to be Amazon to steal my info. I'm really worried about my account now.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"This morning I received a text message that appeared to be from 'USPS'. It said my package couldn't be delivered because of an incomplete address and to click a link to update it.  I was expecting a package, so I clicked the link.  It took me to a website that looked almost exactly like the real USPS website, asking for my address and phone number to 'reschedule delivery'. I filled it out.  Later, I checked the tracking number directly on the official USPS website and there was no problem with my address, and the package was still in transit normally. I realized that text message and the website were fake, trying to steal my personal info by pretending to be USPS.  I'm really worried about what they'll do with my address and phone number now.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"OMG, I'm so mad right now! I just got a text message, like, just now. It looked like it was from my bank, you know, [Bank Name]?  It even had their logo thingy at the top. Said there was some 'suspicious activity' on my account and to click this link to verify my info.  I almost clicked it, I was about to panic! But then I looked at the link closer, and it was all weird and not like my bank's website at all.  It was something totally different, like some random letters and numbers.  I called my bank directly after that, using the number on my bank card, and they said it was NOT them.  They said it's a scam, like people pretending to be them to steal your info!  Seriously, who does that?!  This is total BS, I could have lost everything if I wasn't careful.  Someone is out there pretending to be [Bank Name] and trying to trick people with fake text messages.  They need to be stopped!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I almost got scammed big time! I got an email that looked EXACTLY like it was from Amazon, you know, with the Amazon logo and everything.  It said my account was locked because of some suspicious activity and I needed to click a link to verify my info.  Luckily, something felt off, like the link looked weird when I hovered over it, not the usual Amazon address.  I went to the real Amazon website directly instead of clicking the link in the email, and of course, my account was fine.  This email was a total fake, trying to steal my login details.  They made it look so real, it's scary how good these scammers are getting.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, showed up on my phone as 'Social Security Administration'.  They were saying my social security number was compromised and I needed to give them my bank info to verify my identity.  Sounded kinda fishy but the caller ID looked legit so I was worried.  Luckily I hung up and called the real Social Security number I found online.  They said they never called me and it was a scam, like someone was pretending to be them.  This is messed up, how can people just fake caller ID like that?  Scared me half to death thinking my social security was in trouble.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a text message yesterday, looked like it was from my bank, Chase.  Said there was suspicious activity on my account and to click a link to verify.  Stupid me, I clicked it.  It took me to a website that looked exactly like the Chase login page.  I put in my username and password.  Today, I checked my real bank account and there's a bunch of money missing and weird transactions I didn't make.  I’m pretty sure that text and website were fake and someone stole my info.  This is gonna mess me up big time.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Yesterday, my phone rang and the caller ID said 'Chase Bank'.  I bank with Chase, so I picked up.  The guy on the phone was all serious saying there was fraud on my account and they needed to verify my identity.  He started asking for my account number and password!  Like, right away!  I got super nervous and told him I'd call Chase directly. He kept pushing, saying it had to be done NOW or my account would be locked.  I hung up and called Chase using the number on my bank card.  They told me it was a scam and they never call and ask for that info.  The caller ID was totally faked!  These scammers are getting too good. It was really convincing at first and I was almost tricked into giving them my details.  This caller ID spoofing stuff is dangerous.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I swear I got a call yesterday, caller ID said it was my bank, right?  [Bank Name].  They were all like, 'Urgent security issue on your account, need to verify some stuff.'  Sounded legit, they knew my name and stuff.  They asked for my account password to 'secure it'.  Stupid me, I gave it.  Then today, boom, money's gone from my account.  Called the real bank, they said they NEVER call and ask for passwords.  Said it's caller ID spoofing or something.  Like, they faked being my bank on the phone.  Seriously messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Yesterday, my phone rang and the caller ID showed 'Apple Support'.  I actually use Apple products so I picked up. The guy on the phone said there was suspicious activity on my iCloud account and needed me to verify my password and credit card details to secure it. He sounded really official and even knew my name.  I started to give him the info, but then something felt off. I hung up and called Apple directly using the number on their website. They told me they never call like that and it was definitely a scam, probably caller ID spoofing.  I'm really worried now about my information being out there and how they even got my number to make it look like Apple.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"So, like, I got this call yesterday, right?  My phone showed it was from 'Norton Security' - you know, the antivirus thing?  I use them, so I picked up.  This guy with a really heavy accent starts saying my computer's been hacked and they detected all these viruses.  He wanted me to give him remote access to fix it.  Sounded kinda fishy, but the caller ID said 'Norton', so I almost did it.  Luckily, I got suspicious and hung up.  Then I called Norton directly from their website number and they said they NEVER call like that and it was definitely a scam using caller ID spoofing.  Seriously messed up, they could have gotten into my computer and stolen everything.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a text message this morning, looked like it was from my bank, Chase.  Said there was suspicious activity on my account and to click a link to verify my info.  Thing is, I don't even bank with Chase!  I checked the link, and it looked kinda off, so I didn't click it.  Pretty sure someone was trying to steal my info by pretending to be Chase bank.  This is messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Ugh, I'm so mad. Today I got a text message, right?  Looked like it was from my bank, Chase.  Said 'Urgent! Your account is locked, click here to verify'.  It even had the Chase logo in the text.  Stupid me, I clicked it.  Took me to a website that looked JUST LIKE the Chase login page.  I put in my username and password.  Then, like, a minute later, I got a real alert from Chase saying there was suspicious activity on my account.  I checked and someone tried to transfer money out!  Luckily, Chase caught it.  But I'm pretty sure that text and website were fake, spoofed or something.  It was too real, man.  They even had the right colors and everything.  Someone is trying to steal my money using fake Chase stuff.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Ugh, this is so frustrating.  I got a call earlier and my phone ID said it was from 'Apple Support'.  They said there was suspicious activity on my Apple account and I needed to give them my password to fix it.  I stupidly gave it to them because it looked like it was really Apple calling.  Now I think they stole my password.  How can they make it look like Apple is calling me? This is definitely spoofing, right?",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"This morning I got a call, and the caller ID said it was from 'Internal Revenue Service'.  They were saying I owed back taxes and if I didn't pay right now, they were gonna issue a warrant for my arrest.  I was freaked out, man! It looked exactly like the IRS number on my phone. They told me to go buy gift cards and give them the codes over the phone to settle the debt.  I did it, because I was scared of getting arrested.  Afterwards, I called the real IRS number from their website and they said they never called me and this was a total scam.  Those guys spoofed the IRS number! I lost like, $500 in gift cards!  This is messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a text message this morning, looked like it was from Amazon, you know, the usual delivery update thing.  It said there was a problem with my delivery and I needed to click a link to confirm my address.  Stupidly, I clicked it.  It took me to a website that looked exactly like the Amazon login page. I put in my email and password.  Then, like an idiot, I actually looked at the website address in the browser and it was all gibberish, not amazon.com at all.  I think they stole my login now. I changed my Amazon password but I'm still worried about what they might do.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, and my phone showed it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  I was kinda worried cause I'm retired and depend on that. The guy on the phone said there was some issue with my account and to verify my details, he started asking for my social security number and bank info.  It sounded legit at first 'cause it said Social Security on my caller ID, but then it just felt off, you know?  Like, why would they call me for this stuff? I hung up and called the real Social Security number from their website and they said they never called me and it was a scam, someone spoofing their number.  I'm just reporting this in case they try to do this to someone else.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I swear, this is messed up.  I got an email, looked like it was from Amazon, right?  Said there was a problem with my recent order and I needed to click a link to confirm my details.

I put in my email and password, and then, bam, my bank account gets hit with charges I didn't make.  Checked the email again later, the link was some weird [suspicious domain name] thing.  They totally spoofed Amazon, man, I'm out like 500 bucks now!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I am SO PISSED.  I got this email, looked totally legit, like from PayPal.  Said my account was limited or something, needed to verify.  Had the PayPal logo and everything.

"Dude, I almost got scammed big time today. My phone rang and the caller ID said it was from ""IRS - Criminal Investigation Division"".  Like, seriously, it looked totally legit.  This guy starts yelling about how I owe back taxes and there's a warrant for my arrest if I don't pay RIGHT NOW.  He was super aggressive and kept saying I had to pay with gift cards to avoid jail.  Gift cards?!  That's when I got suspicious. I hung up and called the real IRS number from their website. They said they NEVER call like that and definitely not about warrants and gift cards. They said it was caller ID spoofing and someone was pretending to be them to scare people into paying.  This is messed up, it looked so real on my phone screen.  People could easily fall for this.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"So, I got this email, right? Looked totally legit, had the Amazon logo and everything. Said there was a problem with my account and I needed to update my payment info or they'd shut it down.  Clicked the link in the email, and it took me to a website that looked JUST LIKE Amazon.  I put in my credit card details and everything.  Then, like a week later, I see charges on my card that are definitely not from Amazon.  I went to the real Amazon site, logged in directly, and there was no problem with my account at all.

These people are horrible, trying to scare people like that.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
Someone called me saying they were from Amazon customer service. My caller ID even showed 'Amazon'. They said there was suspicious activity on my account and needed to verify my card details to secure it. I gave them the last four digits of my card before I got suspicious.

I'm worried they might try to use the last four digits to scam me further.,Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, and my phone showed it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  They said my social security number was being used in some fraud case and I needed to verify my details to avoid legal trouble.

This guy with a really aggressive voice starts shouting that I owe back taxes and if I don't pay immediately through some prepaid card, they are sending the police to arrest me.  He knew my name and address which freaked me out. It sounded official at first because of the caller ID, but the way he was talking and demanding payment right away just didn't feel right. I hung up and checked online, and apparently, this is a common scam where they spoof the IRS number to scare people into paying fake debts.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Someone called me this morning, and my phone showed it was from 'Norton Security'.  I use Norton, so I picked up. The guy on the line said my subscription was expiring and they detected a virus on my computer. He sounded really official and said I needed to renew right away and let him access my computer to fix the virus.  He kept saying 'Norton Security Technical Support'. I was worried about the virus thing and almost gave him my credit card info and access to my computer like he asked.  Luckily, my daughter walked in and she told me to hang up because Norton would never call like that. I checked my Norton account online and everything is fine.  I think these people were trying to scam me by pretending to be Norton. My caller ID definitely said 'Norton Security'.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

I hung up and checked online, and it turns out the IRS never calls like that and it’s probably some kind of spoofing thing to trick people.

It even had the Chase logo and everything.  I clicked the link, and it took me to a website that looked exactly like the Chase login page.  I put in my username and password, and then it asked for my debit card number and PIN!  That's when I got suspicious.  Chase NEVER asks for your PIN online.  I closed the page and went straight to the real Chase website and logged in there.  Everything looked fine, but I'm seriously freaked out that I might have given my info to scammers.

I clicked the link anyway just to be sure, and it took me to a website that looked exactly like the Amazon login page.  I put in my email and password, but then it asked for my credit card info which seemed weird just for suspicious activity.  I checked the website address and it was some jumbled mess, not amazon.com.  I realized it was a fake site trying to steal my info.

The website looked just like the real Apple login page, so I put in my Apple ID and password.  After I did it, I got suspicious.

I was expecting a delivery, so I clicked it without even thinking.  It took me to a page that looked exactly like the Amazon login page.  I put in my email and password.  Next day, BAM! My bank account is getting drained and my Amazon account is locked! Turns out, the email and the website were fake.  Spoofed.  They completely ripped off Amazon's look to steal my stuff.  Seriously, how low can you go?",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got an email that looked exactly like it was from Amazon, you know, the usual order confirmation thing. It even had the Amazon logo and everything.  It said there was a problem with my recent order and to click a link to fix it.  Stupid me, I clicked it. It took me to a website that looked JUST LIKE the Amazon login page. I put in my email and password.  Then, like, two days later, my bank called me about suspicious activity on my credit card. Turns out, someone used my Amazon account to buy a bunch of stuff and then used my card. I checked the link from the email again, and now I see it's not the real Amazon address - it's something close but not quite.  I'm so mad and worried about what else they might have gotten.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

It said there was a problem with my recent order and I needed to click a link to verify my payment info.  Stupidly, I clicked it and put in my credit card details and password.  This morning, I see charges on my card that aren't mine and I can't even log into my Amazon account anymore.  I think that email was fake and they stole my info.  This is ridiculous, it looked so real!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"This morning, I received a phone call that appeared to be from my bank, [Bank Name]. The number on my caller ID was the same number I always see when they call me for legitimate reasons.  The person on the phone said there was suspicious activity on my account and they needed to verify my identity to secure it. They asked for my account number and online banking password.  I got suspicious when they started asking for my security questions, as the real bank never asks for those over the phone. I hung up and called my bank directly using the number on my bank statement. They confirmed that they had NOT called me and that it was likely a scam using caller ID spoofing to look like they were calling from [Bank Name]. I'm really worried because I almost gave them my information and I'm concerned about how easily they can fake the caller ID like that. This is scary!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got this email today, looked exactly like it was from Amazon.  Said there was a problem with my recent order and I needed to click a link to verify my account.  I buy a lot from Amazon so I just clicked it without thinking.  It took me to a login page that looked just like Amazon's, so I put in my email and password.  Then after I logged in, it looked weird, not like the real Amazon site.  I checked my real Amazon account directly and there's no problem with my orders.  I think that email was a fake, pretending to be Amazon to steal my password.  Now I'm freaking out they'll get into my account and steal my info or something. This is BS, it looked so real.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

Said my account was on hold because of a payment issue and I needed to update my details right away.  I clicked the link, and it took me to a website that also looked just like Netflix. I put in my credit card info, thinking it was fixing the problem.  Then I got a weird text from my bank about suspicious activity and realized it was all fake.  They totally spoofed Netflix to steal my card details!  I cancelled my card, but I'm still worried about what they might do with my info.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, and my phone said it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  The guy on the phone, he sounded official and knew my name. He said there was some problem with my social security number being used in Texas for illegal stuff, drugs and money laundering, he said.  He told me I needed to verify my information to clear things up and asked for my social security number and bank account details to 'verify my identity'.  It sounded scary and real.  I almost gave him the info, but something felt off.  I hung up and called the real Social Security office number I found online.  They said they never called me and it was a scam, someone was spoofing their number.  I'm really worried now that they might try again or already have some of my information. This whole thing is messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, and the caller ID showed it was from 'Internal Revenue Service'.  I was shocked because, you know, IRS calling you directly is never good. The guy on the phone, he sounded official, like really serious. He said I owed back taxes and if I didn't pay immediately, they were gonna issue a warrant for my arrest.  He was really pushy and kept saying I had to pay with gift cards - which now I know is a HUGE red flag, but in the moment, I was panicked.  I went to the store and bought $500 worth of gift cards and gave him the codes over the phone.  After I hung up, I got to thinking, this whole thing felt wrong. I called the real IRS number from their website, and they said they NEVER call like that and especially not asking for gift cards.

The guy on the phone was saying my account was compromised and I needed to transfer my money to a 'secure account' to protect it. He was so convincing, knew details about my account, I panicked and did exactly what he said.  Later, I called the actual bank using the number on their website, and they told me it was a scam, that they never called me.  They spoofed their number!  All my savings are gone!  How can someone do this? This is absolutely fraudulent and I need help getting my money back.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

They said my bill was overdue and they were gonna shut off my power in like an hour if I didn't pay RIGHT NOW over the phone.  They even knew my address!  I was panicking 'cause I thought I paid it, but maybe I missed it.  They wanted me to use some prepaid card thing, which seemed weird, but I was stressed about the power going out.  Luckily, I decided to call City Power & Light directly using the number on my bill, and they said MY ACCOUNT WAS FINE and they NEVER call people like that for payments.  Turns out, it was a total SCAM! These lowlifes spoofed the power company's number to scare me into paying them.  They almost got me good.

Said I needed to 'verify' my details to stop it and asked for my full social and date of birth.  It sounded legit, but something felt off.  I hung up and called the real SSA number from their website, and they said they NEVER call people like that and it's a common scam.  My caller ID clearly said 'Social Security Administration'!  This has to be spoofing, right?  I'm worried they might have gotten some info even though I didn't give them everything.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Someone sent emails to all my contacts pretending to be me!  They used my name and it looked like it was from my email address, but I checked my sent box and I never sent those emails.

"I got a call today, and the caller ID said it was from 'IRS - Criminal Investigation Division'.  I panicked because I thought, oh god, taxes? They said my social security number was being used in some criminal activity and that I needed to verify my identity and make a payment to avoid arrest.  They were really aggressive and kept saying things like 'This is your final warning' and 'Law enforcement is on their way'.  It sounded so official with all the background noise like a call center.  I almost gave them my bank info, but something felt off. I hung up and called the real IRS number from their website. They said it was a scam, and they never call like that. My caller ID was spoofed!

Went to the real Amazon site myself later and logged in, and there was no problem with my order!  I'm worried now, did I just give my Amazon login to some scammers?  This email thing was totally fake, it was spoofing Amazon to steal my info.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I'm so pissed. Just got a call like an hour ago, and my phone ID said it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  They were saying my SSN was involved in some fraud thing and I needed to 'verify' my info to fix it.  Sounded kinda official at first, especially with the caller ID showing up like that.  They asked for my social security number again to 'confirm' it.  I gave them the last four digits, thankfully not the whole thing. Then they started asking for more personal stuff, like my address and date of birth, and it just felt off, you know?  I hung up and called the real SSA number I found online.  They said they never call people like that and it's probably a scam using caller ID spoofing to look like them.  Seriously, who does that?!  I'm worried they might have enough info to do something now.  This is messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

"Dude, I am so pissed. I got a text message, looked legit, said it was from Amazon about a delivery problem.  Had a link and everything.  Stupid me, I clicked it and it took me to what looked like the Amazon login page. I put in my email and password.  Next thing I know, my Amazon account is locked and I'm getting weird charges.  Turns out, the text wasn't really from Amazon, it was some fake thing to steal my info.  They totally spoofed the message to look real.  Now I gotta deal with Amazon and my bank.  This is a nightmare.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Ugh, I'm so mad at myself. This morning my phone rings, and it shows up as ""Social Security Administration"" on the caller ID.  Like, it looked totally legit. Some lady on the phone says there's a problem with my social security number and starts asking for my date of birth and address to 'verify' things. Because it said Social Security on my phone, I started giving her info. Then she asked for my bank account details to 'fix' the issue and that's when I got suspicious and hung up.  I checked online and saw all these scams about people spoofing government numbers. I'm really worried they got some of my info already because my caller ID showed it was really them.  I feel so stupid for almost falling for it.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Yesterday I received a phone call.  My caller ID showed 'Internal Revenue Service' as the caller.  This guy on the phone, he was yelling, saying I owed a lot of money to the IRS and if I didn't pay immediately they were going to send the cops to arrest me.  It sounded like a scam because the IRS always sends letters, not calls like this.  I think they made it look like it was the IRS on my phone, but it wasn't really them.  I'm really freaked out.  I'm worried they might have gotten some of my information already.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I almost got scammed today! I got an email, looked totally legit, said it was from Amazon about my recent order.  Had the Amazon logo and everything.  Said there was a problem with my payment and I needed to update it right away or my order would be cancelled.  I clicked the link in the email, it took me to what looked EXACTLY like the Amazon login page.  I was about to put in my password when something felt off.  The website address looked a bit weird, like not quite the real Amazon one.  I went to the real Amazon website directly instead, and checked my orders there.  Everything was fine!  No payment problem.  I checked the email again, and yeah, looking closer now the 'from' address is kinda dodgy.  Definitely a fake.  They tried to trick me into giving them my Amazon login details!  So angry and freaked out, like how real these scams are getting now!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a text message saying it was from the IRS.  Said I owed back taxes and if I didn't pay right away they were gonna like, put a lien on my house or something.  It had a link to click to pay. I almost did it, cause it looked kinda official with the IRS logo and stuff in the text. But then I called my accountant and she said the IRS never contacts you by text and it's probably a scam.  So I think someone is pretending to be the IRS to steal money.  This has to be illegal, right?  Scared the crap out of me.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"So, like, my grandma got a call the other day, and her phone said it was from 'Medicare'.  They were asking for her social security number to 'verify her benefits' or something.  Sounded fishy to me, 'cause why would Medicare call and ask for that outta nowhere?  I told her to hang up and call Medicare directly from the number on her card.  She did, and they said they never called and it was probably a scammer spoofing their number.  Good thing she didn't give them anything, but it really freaked her out.  These people are evil, man, preying on old folks.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I am freaking out. I got this email, looked totally legit, like from Amazon, you know? Said there was a problem with my account and I needed to click a link to fix it.  Stupid me, I clicked it and it took me to a website that looked JUST LIKE Amazon's login. I put in my email and password.  Then, like, two hours later, I get a fraud alert from my bank! Someone tried to buy a bunch of stuff using my card. I'm pretty sure that email and website were fake, like they were pretending to be Amazon to steal my info.  This is messed up!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

I clicked the link in the email, and it took me to a website that looked just like the Amazon login page. I put in my email and password.  The next day, my bank called me about suspicious activity on my credit card. Turns out, it wasn't Amazon at all, it was some fake website designed to steal my info.  They completely spoofed the email and the website. I'm so mad and worried about what else they might do with my information.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a text message saying it was from Amazon, saying there was a problem with my recent order and to click a link to verify my details.  Stupidly, I clicked it because I DID order something recently. The website looked just like Amazon, same colors, logo, everything.  It asked for my login and password, then my credit card info and address.  I put it all in.  Then, like, a lightbulb went off, and I looked at the website address and it was all weird, not the real Amazon address.  I think I got totally spoofed. I changed my Amazon password, but I'm worried they have my credit card now.  This is messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, and my phone showed it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  They said my social security number was compromised and I needed to verify my details to avoid suspension.  The guy on the phone was really pushy and sounded official, using all these legal sounding terms. He asked for my date of birth and address, and then started asking for my bank account number! That's when I got suspicious. I hung up and called the real Social Security office. They told me they never call like that and it was definitely a scam, someone spoofing their number. I'm worried because I gave them my date of birth and address before I realized it was fake.  This is scary, people are pretending to be the government to steal your info!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I almost got completely ripped off today. My phone rang, and the caller ID said it was 'IRS'.  Like, seriously, the Internal Revenue Service.  They said I owed back taxes and if I didn't pay immediately, they were gonna issue a warrant for my arrest.  The guy was yelling and threatening me.  He told me to go buy gift cards and read him the numbers over the phone to settle the debt.  It sounded so official and scary, I was actually about to do it!  Luckily, my neighbor overheard me freaking out and told me to hang up and call the real IRS number from their website.  I did, and they said it was a scam and they NEVER call like that.  Someone is spoofing the IRS number to scare people into giving them money.  This is messed up and needs to stop before someone who doesn't know better loses everything.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"This morning I got a text message, said it was from 'USPS' about a package needing delivery confirmation.  Looked legit, had the USPS logo and everything.  It had a link to click to 'confirm my address'. I clicked it, and it took me to a website that looked just like the real USPS site, asking for my address and card details for a small 'redelivery fee'.  Something felt off, the website address was a bit weird, not the usual USPS one.  I checked the real USPS site directly and there was no issue with any package.  I think that text and website were fake, spoofing USPS to steal my card info.  Pretty sure it's a scam.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Yesterday, my phone rang and the caller ID showed 'City Police Dept.'  I picked up thinking maybe something was wrong in my neighborhood. This guy on the phone sounded like a cop, all serious and official. He said my son was in trouble, had been in an accident and was arrested for DUI.  He said I needed to wire money immediately to get him bailed out.  I was panicking, ready to do anything to help my son.  But then I called my son's cell and thankfully he answered, totally fine and at home!  Turns out the police department never called me, it was all fake. They spoofed the police number to scare me and get money.  These people are sick!  I reported it to the real police, they said it's a common scam using caller ID spoofing.  I was so close to sending them money, thinking it was real.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I almost got scammed so bad today. My phone rang, and the caller ID said it was 'Social Security Administration'.  They said my social security number was linked to some illegal activity and I had to give them money to fix it or I'd be arrested.  Sounded totally legit at first 'cause it said 'Social Security' right on my phone!  I was about to panic and send them money through gift cards like they asked, but something felt off. I hung up and called the real Social Security number I found online, and they said it was a total scam and they NEVER call like that.  This has to be one of those spoofing things, making it look like it's them calling when it's not.  Scary stuff, man.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Yesterday I got an email that looked exactly like it was from Amazon, saying my account was locked because of suspicious activity.  It had the Amazon logo and everything. They told me to click a link to verify my info. I did it, and it took me to a page that looked just like the Amazon login. I put in my username and password. Today, my credit card got charged for stuff I didn't buy and I can't even log into my real Amazon account anymore. I'm pretty sure that email was fake and they tricked me with a fake website. It was a total spoof.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

It took me to a website that looked just like the Amazon login page.  I put in my email and password like an idiot.  This morning I got a weird email from some address I don't know saying 'thanks for your login'.  I'm so worried they've got my Amazon account now, or worse, my payment info.  I checked the link again in the text, and it's not the real Amazon website address, it's some dodgy thing.  I think I got spoofed.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Dude, I almost fell for it.  Got an email, looked legit, like from Amazon Prime.  Said my account was locked 'cause of some weird activity and I needed to click a link to verify my info.  The email address looked kinda off, but the logo and everything was spot on.  Good thing I double-checked the link before clicking - it was some janky website, not Amazon at all.  Pretty sure they were trying to steal my password or credit card or something.  This has to be spoofing, right?  Making fake emails to trick people.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I am absolutely furious! I just got off the phone and I'm pretty sure I was scammed. My phone rang, and the caller ID said it was 'IRS - Internal Revenue Service'.  They were super official sounding, saying I owed back taxes and if I didn't pay immediately, they were going to issue a warrant for my arrest.  They even knew my name and address!  I was so scared I almost gave them my credit card info, but something felt off.

"My email... it's been hacked or something. People I know are getting emails from my address, but I DIDN'T SEND THEM!  It's asking for money, saying I'm stuck overseas and need help.  My cousin called me freaking out, saying he almost wired money before he called to double-check. This is insane! Someone is making it look like it's coming from me, but it's not. They're using my email to scam people! I need this stopped, like, yesterday.  This is ruining my reputation and scaring my family and friends.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Okay, so like, yesterday I got this email that looked EXACTLY like it was from Amazon.  The whole thing, logo, colors, everything. It said there was a problem with my recent order and I needed to click a link to confirm my payment info.  Stupid me, I clicked it.  It took me to a page that looked just like the Amazon login page, so I put in my email and password.  This morning, I checked my bank account and there were a bunch of weird charges I didn't make.  I went to the real Amazon website, logged in directly, and there was no problem with any order.

"This morning I received a text message that appeared to be from 'USPS'. It said my package couldn't be delivered because of an incomplete address and to click a link to update it.  I was expecting a package, so I clicked the link.  It took me to a website that looked almost exactly like the real USPS website, asking for my address and phone number to 'reschedule delivery'. I filled it out.  Later, I checked the tracking number directly on the official USPS website and there was no problem with my address, and the package was still in transit normally. I realized that text message and the website were fake, trying to steal my personal info by pretending to be USPS.  I'm really worried about what they'll do with my address and phone number now.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"OMG, I'm so mad right now! I just got a text message, like, just now. It looked like it was from my bank, you know, [Bank Name]?  It even had their logo thingy at the top. Said there was some 'suspicious activity' on my account and to click this link to verify my info.  I almost clicked it, I was about to panic! But then I looked at the link closer, and it was all weird and not like my bank's website at all.  It was something totally different, like some random letters and numbers.  I called my bank directly after that, using the number on my bank card, and they said it was NOT them.  They said it's a scam, like people pretending to be them to steal your info!  Seriously, who does that?!  This is total BS, I could have lost everything if I wasn't careful.  Someone is out there pretending to be [Bank Name] and trying to trick people with fake text messages.

It said my account was locked because of some suspicious activity and I needed to click a link to verify my info.  Luckily, something felt off, like the link looked weird when I hovered over it, not the usual Amazon address.

I got super nervous and told him I'd call Chase directly. He kept pushing, saying it had to be done NOW or my account would be locked.  I hung up and called Chase using the number on my bank card.  They told me it was a scam and they never call and ask for that info.  The caller ID was totally faked!  These scammers are getting too good. It was really convincing at first and I was almost tricked into giving them my details.  This caller ID spoofing stuff is dangerous.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

Called the real bank, they said they NEVER call and ask for passwords.  Said it's caller ID spoofing or something.  Like, they faked being my bank on the phone.  Seriously messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Yesterday, my phone rang and the caller ID showed 'Apple Support'.  I actually use Apple products so I picked up. The guy on the phone said there was suspicious activity on my iCloud account and needed me to verify my password and credit card details to secure it. He sounded really official and even knew my name.  I started to give him the info, but then something felt off. I hung up and called Apple directly using the number on their website.

Seriously messed up, they could have gotten into my computer and stolen everything.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a text message this morning, looked like it was from my bank, Chase.  Said there was suspicious activity on my account and to click a link to verify my info.

This guy starts yelling about how I owe back taxes and there's a warrant for my arrest if I don't pay RIGHT NOW.  He was super aggressive and kept saying I had to pay with gift cards to avoid jail.  Gift cards?!  That's when I got suspicious. I hung up and called the real IRS number from their website. They said they NEVER call like that and definitely not about warrants and gift cards.

This guy with a really aggressive voice starts shouting that I owe back taxes and if I don't pay immediately through some prepaid card, they are sending the police to arrest me.  He knew my name and address which freaked me out. It sounded official at first because of the caller ID, but the way he was talking and demanding payment right away just didn't feel right.

It even had the Chase logo and everything.  I clicked the link, and it took me to a website that looked exactly like the Chase login page.  I put in my username and password, and then it asked for my debit card number and PIN!  That's when I got suspicious.  Chase NEVER asks for your PIN online.

I put in my email and password, but then it asked for my credit card info which seemed weird just for suspicious activity.

I checked online and found out about caller ID spoofing and fake websites. I think I got scammed. My caller ID said 'Apple Inc.' but it must have been fake and the website too. I'm really worried about my Apple account now and what they can do with my info.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got a call yesterday, and my phone ID showed it was from 'Apple Support'.  They said my iCloud account was compromised and they needed to verify my details to fix it. They asked for my Apple ID password and security questions.  Stupidly, I gave it to them because the caller ID looked legit.  Then today, I tried to log into my Apple account and the password was changed! I realized it was a fake call, spoofing the Apple Support number.  Now I can't get into my account and I'm worried they stole all my stuff.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Yesterday I got a text message, looked like it was from my bank, Chase.  Said my account was locked and I needed to click a link to verify my info.  It looked kinda real, had the Chase logo and stuff.  I clicked it and it took me to a website that looked just like the Chase login page.  I put in my username and password.  This morning, I logged into my *real* Chase account and saw a bunch of weird transactions I didn't make.  I think that website was fake and they stole my info!  This is messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"OMG, I'm so freaked out. I got a call today, and my phone ID said it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  They said my SSN was compromised and used for illegal stuff and I needed to 'verify' myself to avoid legal trouble. They asked for my full social security number AGAIN and my bank account details to 'secure' my funds.  It sounded kinda legit at first, but then the guy got really pushy and kept saying I had to do it NOW.  Something felt off, so I hung up and called the real Social Security number from their website.  They said they NEVER call like that and it's a total scam using caller ID spoofing.  I'm so worried someone else will fall for this crap and lose their money or identity.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I'm really freaked out. Today I got a call, and my phone ID showed it was from 'Social Security Administration'.  They said my social security number was being used in some crime in Texas, which is crazy because I live in Florida and haven't been to Texas in years. The guy on the phone, he sounded really official, said I needed to verify my info to clear things up and avoid legal trouble. He asked for my social security number again and my date of birth, and I gave it to him because I was so nervous and worried about my social security being messed up.  After I hung up, I thought about it more, and it just felt wrong.  I called the real Social Security office number I found online, and they said they never call people like that and especially not about legal things over the phone.  I think someone spoofed the caller ID and tricked me. I'm so worried about identity theft now, and what they're gonna do with my info.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Today, my phone rang, and it showed up as my sister, Sarah.  Her number popped right up on my screen. So naturally, I picked up. But it wasn't Sarah. Some dude was on the line, real pushy, asking for my social security and birthday!  Said it was for some 'prize' or something.  It just felt wrong, so I hung up fast. I called Sarah right away on her actual number, and she was like, 'I didn't call you!'  Someone is totally faking her number on my caller ID to try and trick people!  It's creepy and messed up.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Someone sent emails to all my clients pretending to be me! They used my business name and logo, everything looked legit.  They were asking for payments to a different account, not mine. My clients are calling me confused and some might have already paid them! This is gonna ruin my business reputation.  I checked the email headers and the sender address is totally fake, but it shows up as my business name in their inboxes.  This is email spoofing, right?  I need to report this ASAP.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"This is unbelievable! I got a call today, and the caller ID showed it was from 'Social Security Administration'.

They asked for my social security number and bank account info right then and there!  It sounded so real and scary, I almost gave it to them.  But something felt off, so I hung up and called the real Social Security office myself.  Turns out, they never called me!  They said it's a scam, someone is spoofing their number to steal people's information.  I feel so stupid for almost falling for it.  People need to know about this!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I just got a call, and my caller ID showed it was from the 'IRS'.  Freaked me out completely.  The guy on the phone was yelling about back taxes and threatened to send the cops to arrest me if I didn't pay immediately.  He wanted my credit card number right there and then.  I was panicking because it looked like a real IRS call on my phone.  Luckily, I got suspicious and hung up.  I called the real IRS number later and they said it's a scam and people are faking their caller ID to look like them.  This is terrifying, they almost got me to pay them money!",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"I got an email yesterday, looked exactly like it was from Amazon, you know, with the logo and everything. Said there was a problem with my recent order and I needed to click a link to verify my details.  Clicked it, took me to a website that looked just like the Amazon login page. I put in my email and password.  Then today, I get a fraud alert from my bank! Turns out my Amazon account was used to buy a bunch of stuff I didn't order.  I'm pretty sure that email and website were fake, spoofed to look like Amazon.  I'm so mad and worried about my credit card now.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime
"Ugh, I am so mad and freaked out right now.  I just got a call, and my phone ID said it was from 'Internal Revenue Service'.  Like, seriously?  My heart jumped into my throat. This guy on the phone was all official sounding, saying there was a warrant out for my arrest because of some tax fraud thing.  He said I needed to pay money RIGHT NOW to stop the police from coming.  He even knew my name and last four of my social security!  I was panicking, almost gave him my card number.  But then I thought, wait a minute, this feels wrong.  IRS doesn't call like this, do they?  So I hung up and googled 'IRS scam calls'.  Turns out, it's a HUGE scam, they're spoofing the IRS number to scare people!  These lowlifes are using caller ID spoofing to pretend to be the government!  It was so convincing, I almost fell for it.  Someone needs to stop these criminals.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

A guy with a serious voice said there was some problem with my social security number and potential fraud. He asked me to verify my date of birth and social security number to 'confirm my identity' and 'fix the issue'.  I got nervous and gave him the info.  After I hung up, I felt something was off.

He was saying I needed to verify my info to fix it and avoid getting arrested.  He asked for my social security number and date of birth.  I got kinda freaked out and gave it to him.  Then he started asking for bank account details, and that's when I got suspicious.  I hung up and called the real Social Security office, and they told me it was a scam, that they never call like that.  My caller ID showed 'Social Security Admin' though, I swear it did.

They said there's like, a warrant for my arrest or something crazy, and I needed to pay some fine RIGHT NOW to avoid getting arrested.  They were super pushy and sounded legit, knew my name and everything.  I almost panicked and was gonna wire them money, but my gut was telling me something was off.  I hung up and called the real police department number from Google, and they said it's a scam, some kind of spoofing thing with the caller ID.  Seriously, who does this?!  I'm still shaken up, it felt so real.",Spoofing,Other Cyber Crime

This guy on the phone, he sounded all official and knew my name and stuff. He said my account was compromised and that I needed to give him access to my computer to fix it.  He sent me a link to some website that looked just like the Apple website, all white and with the apple logo.  I logged in there, thinking it was real.  Then he started asking for like, all sorts of passwords and security questions for everything!  That's when I got a bad feeling.  I hung up and called Apple directly from their real website.
